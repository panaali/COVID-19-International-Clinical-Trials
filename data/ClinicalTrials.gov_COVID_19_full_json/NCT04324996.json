            "textblock": "SARS-CoV-2 infection mainly leads to interstitial pneumonia. The patients with low immunity\n      have more serious conditions. At present, there is no specific drug/therapy available for\n      COVID-19. NK cells are the major cells of the natural immune system, which are essential for\n      innate immunity and adaptive immunity, and are indispensable in the defense of virus\n      infection. NKG2D is an activating receptor of NK cells, which can recognize and thus clear\n      virus infected cells. NK cells modified by CAR play a role in targeted cell therapy, and have\n      benn demonstrated very safe without severe side effects such as cytokine releasing syndromes.\n      The survival time of NK cells will be very short if there is no IL-15-sustained support after\n      adoptive transfer into the body. In comparison with natural IL-15 in vivo, IL-15 superagonist\n      (sIL-15/IL-15R\u0251 chimeric protein) has increased the activity by nearly 20 times and as well\n      as improved pharmacokinetic characteristics with longer persistence and enhanced target\n      cytotoxicity. CAR-T cell-mediated cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity have been\n      shown to be abrogated through GM-CSF neutralization. ACE2 is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and\n      binds to S protein of the virus envelope. We have constructed and prepared the universal\n      off-the-shelf IL15 superagonist- and GM-CSF neutralizing scFv-secreting NKG2D-ACE2 CAR-NK\n      derived from cord blood. By targeting the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and NKG2DL on the surface\n      of infected cells with ACE2 and NKG2D, respectively, and with the strong synergistic effect\n      of IL15 superagonist and CRS prevention through GM-CSF neutralizing scFv, we hope that the\n      SARS-CoV-2 virus particles and their infected cells can be safely and effectively removed,\n      thus providing a safe and effective cell therapy for COVID-19. In addition, ACE2 CAR-NK cells\n      can competitively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection of type II alveolar epithelial cells and other\n      important organ or tissue cells through ACE2 so as to make SARS-CoV-2 abortive infection\n      (i.e., no production of infectious virus particles).\n\n      This project is an open, randomized, parallel, multicenter phase I/II clinical trial. The\n      NKG2D-ACE2 CAR-NK cells secreting super IL15 superagonist and GM-CSF neutralizing scFv are\n      going to be give by intravenous infusion (108 cells per kilogram of body weight, once a week)\n      for the treatment of 30 patients with each common, severe and critical type COVID-19,\n      respectively."
