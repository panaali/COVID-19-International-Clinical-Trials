U-DEPLOY helps\n      to facilitate timely conduct of studies across the University Health Network and other\n      centers."

            "textblock": "Multifocal interstitial pneumonia is the most common cause of deterioration in people with\n      COVID-19. This is attributed to a severe reaction where releases too many cytokines (proteins\n      that play an important role in immune responses) which rush into the lungs resulting in lung\n      inflammation and fluid buildup. This can lead to damage to the lungs and leading to breathing\n      problems. Ruxolitinib when given early in the disease, may prevent the overproduction of\n      cytokines which, in turn, may prevent lung damage."
