Geriatricians were asked to complete the survey for their last 10 patients\n      infected by the SARS-CoV-2. The study was declared to the Commission Nationale de\n      l'Informatique et des Libert\u00e9s (CNIL) under the number ar20-0031v1.\n\n      For each patient, demographic characteristics (age, gender, residence place, care place,\n      autonomy according to the Groupe Iso Ressource (GIR)), medical history (presence of major\n      neurocognitive disorder, hypertension, diabetes, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary\n      disease (COPD), heart pathology, severe renal failure with a clearance of creatinine under\n      30ml/min, solid or liquid cancer) were collected. The symptoms within de 72 hours of the\n      actual disease were also collected for each patient including geriatric syndromes (fall,\n      hypoactive or hyperactive delirium, altered general status, altered conscience), general\n      symptoms (temperature, blood pressure), respiratory symptoms (cough, polypnea), ear nose and\n      throat (ENT) symptoms (rhinorrhea, odynophagia, otalgia, conjunctivitis, ageusia or\n      dysgeusia, anosmia), digestive symptoms (diarrhea, nausea or vomiting), and blood formula\n      modification (leucopenia (with count if available), lymphopenia (with count if available),\n      thrombopenia (with count if available).\n\n      Procedure Data were collected by the physician who was in charge of the patient between March\n      22, 2020 and April 5, 2020.\n\n      Given the main objective of the study was only descriptive, no calculation was required\n      concerning the number of subjects to include in the study."
