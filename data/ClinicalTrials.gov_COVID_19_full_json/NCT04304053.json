As viral loads decline to\n      undetectable levels, the probability of onward transmission is reduced to very low levels.\n      Such evaluation will require prospective surveillance to assess the population-level effect\n      of transmission prevention.\n\n      Drug interventions in this protocol will follow the Spanish law about off-label use of\n      medicines."

            "textblock": "Previous research on influenza has indicated that antiviral drugs administered before o short\n      after symptom onset can reduce infectiousness to others by reducing viral loads in the\n      respiratory secretions of patients.\n\n      Lopinavir/ritonavir, a protease inhibitor used to treat HIV/AIDS, was found to block COVID-19\n      infection in vitro at low-micromolar concentration, with a half-maximal effective\n      concentration (EC50) of 8.5 \u03bcM. China's guidelines were set up in January 2020 and treated\n      hospitalized patients with lopinavir/ritonavir, either alone or with various combinations.\n      Darunavir (DRV)/Cobicistat, is also a protease inhibitor used to treat and prevent HIV/AIDS.\n      Its as effective as lopinavir/ritonavir for the treatment of HIV/AIDS and better tolerated\n      because the adverse effects rate is lower (diarrhea 2% vs 27%).\n\n      Another promising drug is chloroquine, that showed excellent in vitro results and strong\n      antiviral effects on SARS-CoV infection of primate cells. Results from n=100 patients have\n      shown superiority to the control treatment in improving lung imaging findings, promoting\n      virus reversion to negative and shortening the disease."
