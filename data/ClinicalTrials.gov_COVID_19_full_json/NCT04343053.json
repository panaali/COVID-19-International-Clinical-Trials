The first reports from\n      China suggested in patients with SARS-Cov-2 infection a heightened inflammatory burden\n      associated with significant changes in coagulative status (i.e. low platelet count, increased\n      D-dimer) and dysfunction of micro-vessels in pulmonary circulation.\n\n      No data are available about patterns and changes in platelet reactivity, activation of\n      coagulation factors and endothelial function during SARS-Cov-2 infection.\n\n      The present study is ideated to fill this gap. Patients with moderate to severe respiratory\n      failure due to SARS-Cov-2 infection will be enrolled. One blood sample will be obtained from\n      each patient at the early, mid and late stage of disease. Several markers of platelet,\n      coagulation and endothelial function will be related with laboratory, clinical,\n      electrocardiographic, imaging (transthoracic echocardiogram, pulmonary ultrasonography,\n      computed tomography) and outcome data"
