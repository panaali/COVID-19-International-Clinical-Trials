            "textblock": "In December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases was reported in Wuhan, China, and a novel\n      coronavirus, SARS-Cov-2, was identified. The World Health Organization (WHO) designated the\n      respiratory disease as coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on February 12, 2020. Numerous reports\n      have since characterized the COVID-19 clinical syndrome, ranging from asymptomatic/mild\n      disease to severe disease leading to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation\n      (i.e., ARDS, multi-organ failure, sepsis, and death).\n\n      A safe, effective, and inexpensive therapy is urgently needed, one that can alter the natural\n      course of the disease process and reduce strain on healthcare systems. High Dose Intravenous\n      Vitamin C is a safe and possibly effective treatment for ARDS and has been described to be\n      effective for ARDS of viral origin.\n\n      A double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized control trial from our institution involving\n      167 patients with ARDS who were randomized to receive 50 mg/kg every 6 hours of HDIVC for 4\n      days versus placebo showed a statistically significant difference in 28-day all-cause\n      mortality. The 28-day mortality was 29.8% in the vitamin C group versus 46.3% in the placebo\n      group, although this was a secondary outcome.\n\n      This can be translated as a Number Needed to Treat (NNT) of 6-8 patients to save one life\n      from ARDS. The statistical effect on mortality remained up to 60-days following trial\n      completion.\n\n      We, therefore, cannot withhold the treatment from patients with ARDS. It remains unknown if\n      HDIVC given early can prevent the progression to ARDS and if it is effective in COVID-19\n      ARDS.\n\n      The first study, published in 1986, treated 16 ARDS patients with intravenous vitamin C (1000\n      mg IV every 6 hours) plus antioxidants versus 16 ARDS patients who received the standard care\n      at that time (i.e., control group). There was a reduction in mortality in the vitamin C\n      group: 37% versus 71% in the standard care group (p<0.01). A phase I trial in 2014 proved\n      that plasma vitamin C in patients with severe sepsis and ARDS were low, almost at scorbutic\n      levels and that HDIVC administration had a dose-dependent effect in the prevention of\n      multi-organ failure, as measured by the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores.\n\n      Patients who received a total of 200 mg/kg/day of HDIVC for 4 days (administered in 50\n      mg/kg/dose, every 6 hours), had significantly lower organ failure scores than placebo, and\n      even lower scores than the patients who received lower-doses of IV vitamin C (50 mg/kg/day\n      administered at 12.5 mg/kg/dose, every 6 hours for 4 days). In this trial, the patients in\n      the HDIVC group (200 mg/kg/day) achieved plasma levels up to 3,000 \u00b5M on day 4.\n\n      To assess the treatment effect of a 72-hour intravenous vitamin C infusion protocol (100\n      mg/kg every 8 hours) in patients with hypoxemia and suspected COVID-19 (Novel Coronavirus\n      ID-19). In the course of performing this phase 2 trial we will explore three following\n      hypotheses:\n\n      Primary Endpoint: HDIVC infusion will increase 28-day ventilator-free days. Secondary\n      Endpoint A: HDIVC infusion will reduce 28-day all-cause hospital mortality.\n\n      Secondary Endpoint B: HDIVC infusion will significantly increase acute inflammation-free days\n      (defined as CRP >=10 mg/L) among COVID-19 patients.\n\n      Secondary Endpoint C: HDIVC infusion will be safe, as demonstrated by organ-failure-free days\n      up to 28 days."
