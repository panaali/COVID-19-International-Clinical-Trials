The cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR, and all patients were evaluated with CT,\n      cutoff values were obtained according to the Yoden index, and were divided into high CT score\n      group and low CT score group. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data\n      were collected."
