Despite\n      the rapid spread of the disease globally, there is no solid data yet to recommend any\n      specific treatments, which is why symptomatic, organ supportive therapy including respiratory\n      therapy in acute pulmonary failure is recommended. There has been reported a high incidence\n      of bacterial super-infections in patients with COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 also have a\n      higher risk of dying because of septic shock. Thus, there is an urgent need for treatment\n      that can improve the patient's chance of the shortest hospitalization possible, and treatment\n      that can lower the risk of secondary infection and death.\n\n      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded multi-center trial evaluating the\n      effect of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine treatment in patients with COVID-19 during\n      hospitalization. The aim of the study is to investigate whether the treatment can shorten\n      hospitalization, reduce the risk of non-invasive ventilation, admittance to Intensive Care\n      Units and death."}, "overall_status": "Not yet recruiting", "start_date": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "April 1, 2020"}, "completion_date": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "March 31, 2021"}, "primary_completion_date": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "October 31, 2020"}, "phase": "Phase 4", "study_type": "Interventional", "has_expanded_access": "No", "study_design_info": {"allocation": "Randomized", "intervention_model": "Parallel Assignment", "primary_purpose": "Treatment", "masking": "Quadruple (Participant, Care Provider, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)"}, "primary_outcome": {"measure": "Number of days alive and discharged from hospital within 14 days", "time_frame": "14 days"}, "secondary_outcome": [{"measure": "Categorization of hospitalization status", "time_frame": "14 days", "description": "The patient will becategorized into one of the following 8 categories depending on status of their hospitalization:\nDead (yes/no)\nHospitalized and receiving mechanical ventilation or ExtraCorporalMembraneOxygenation (ECMO) (yes/no)\nHospitalized and receiving Non-invasive ventilation or \"high-flow oxygen device\" (yes/no)\nHospitalized and given oxygen supplements different from (2) and (3) (yes/no)\nHospitalized and without oxygen treatment, but receiving other treatment (both related to COVID-19 or other) (yes/no)\nHospitalized for observation (yes/no)\nDischarged from hospital with restriction of activity level (yes/no)\nDischarged from hospital without any restrictions of activity level (yes/no)\nOnly one category can be \"yes\"."}, {"measure": "Admitted to intensive care unit, if admitted to ICU then length of stay", "time_frame": "14 days"}, {"measure": "Have used Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) during hospitalization", "time_frame": "14 days"}, {"measure": "Mortality", "time_frame": "30 days"}, {"measure": "Length of hospitalization", "time_frame": "14 days"}, {"measure": "Days alive and discharged from hospital", "time_frame": "30 days"}, {"measure": "Mortality", "time_frame": "90 days"}, {"measure": "Mortality", "time_frame": "365 days"}, {"measure": "Number of readmissions (all causes)", "time_frame": "30 days"}, {"measure": "Number of days using non-invasive ventilation (NIV)", "time_frame": "14 days"}, {"measure": "Change in patient's oxygen partial pressure", "time_frame": "4 days", "description": "Delta PaO2 measured in arterial puncture"}, {"measure": "Change in patient's carbondioxid partial pressure", "time_frame": "4 days", "description": "Delta PaCO2 measured in arterial puncture"}, {"measure": "Level of pH in blood", "time_frame": "4 days", "description": "pH measured in arterial puncture"}, {"measure": "Time for no oxygen supplement (or regular oxygen supplement \"LTOT\")", "time_frame": "14 days"}], "number_of_arms": "2", "enrollment": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "226"}, "condition": ["Virus Diseases", "Infection Viral"], "arm_group": [{"arm_group_label": "Control", "arm_group_type": "Placebo Comparator", "description": "This arm will receive standard care and placebo in 15 days."}, {"arm_group_label": "Intervention", "arm_group_type": "Active Comparator", "description": "This arm will receive standard care and azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine in 15 days."}], "intervention": [{"intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Azithromycin", "description": "Azithromycin", "arm_group_label": "Intervention"}, {"intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Hydroxychloroquine", "description": "Hydroxychloroquine", "arm_group_label": "Intervention"}, {"intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Placebo oral tablet", "description": "Placebo Azithromycin", "arm_group_label": "Control"}, {"intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Placebo oral tablet", "description": "Placebo Hydroxychloroquine", "arm_group_label": "Control"}], "eligibility": {"criteria": {"textblock": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n          -
