Because there is no standard treatment for this infection, patients are\n      being asked to volunteer for a gene transfer research study using mesenchymal stem cells\n      (MSCs).\n\n      Stem cells are cells that do not yet have a specific function in the body. Mesenchymal stem\n      cells (MSCs) are a type of stem cell that can be grown from bone marrow (the spongy tissue\n      inside of bones). Stem cells can develop into other types of more mature (specific) cells,\n      such as blood and muscle cells.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to see if MSCs can help to treat respiratory infections caused\n      by SARS-CoV-2."
