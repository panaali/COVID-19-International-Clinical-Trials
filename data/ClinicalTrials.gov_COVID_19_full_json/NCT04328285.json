Within weeks, COVID-19 became a pandemic.\n\n      In the absence of specific antiviral treatment, a special attention should be given to\n      prevention. Personal protection equipments may be insufficiently protective, including in\n      healthcare workers, a significant proportion of whom (around 4%) having been infected in the\n      outbreaks described in China and more recently in Italy. Infection in healthcare workers\n      could result from the contact with COVID-19 people in community or with infected colleagues\n      or patients.\n\n      As it will take at least a year before vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 becomes available,\n      chemoprophylaxis is an option that should be considered in this setting where prevention of\n      SARS-CoV-2 infection in Health Care Workers.\n\n      The COVIDAXIS trial evaluates a chemoprophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Health Care\n      Workers. This trial is divided into two distinct studies that could start independently each\n      with its own randomization process: COVIDAXIS 1 will study Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) versus\n      placebo; COVIDAXIS 2 will study Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) versus placebo.\n\n      Upon randomization healthcare workers (HCWs) involved in the management of suspected or\n      confirmed COVID-19 cases will be assigned to one of the following 2 treatment groups:"
