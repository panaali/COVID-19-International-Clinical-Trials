Within weeks, COVID-19 became a pandemic.\n\n      In the absence of specific antiviral treatment, a special attention should be given to\n      prevention. Personal protection equipments may be insufficiently protective, including in\n      healthcare workers, a significant proportion of whom (around 4%) having been infected in the\n      outbreaks described in China and more recently in Italy. Infection in healthcare workers\n      could result from the contact with COVID-19 people in community or with infected colleagues\n      or patients.\n\n      As it will take at least a year before vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 becomes available,\n      chemoprophylaxis is an option that should be considered in this setting where prevention of\n      SARS-CoV-2 infection in Health Care Workers.\n\n      The COVIDAXIS trial evaluates a chemoprophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Health Care\n      Workers. This trial is divided into two distinct studies that could start independently each\n      with its own randomization process: COVIDAXIS 1 will study Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) versus\n      placebo; COVIDAXIS 2 will study Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) versus placebo.\n\n      Upon randomization healthcare workers (HCWs) involved in the management of suspected or\n      confirmed COVID-19 cases will be assigned to one of the following 2 treatment groups:"}, "detailed_description": {"textblock": "The study COVIDAXIS 1( Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) versus placebo) will be realized on 600\n      participants and will be implemented first in as many centers as possible.\n\n      Upon randomization healthcare workers involved in the management of suspected or confirmed\n      COVID-19 cases will be assigned to one of the following 2 treatment groups:\n\n        -
