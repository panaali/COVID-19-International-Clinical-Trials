First, although the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infect lung and intestine, many\n      patients suddenly take a turn for the worse even when the viral replication appears to be\n      under control. Second, patients with serious or critical clinical symptoms show remarked T\n      cell lymphopenia that are more severe and more acute than human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\n      infection. Functional exhaustion of T cells is suggested by high expression of T-cell\n      exhaustion markers, which again appears more acute than in HIV patients. Third, multiple\n      cytokines are elevated among patients with severe clinical symptoms, which potentially\n      explains the multiple organ failure associated with COVID-19. For these reasons, treatment of\n      COVID-19 likely requires a combination of both antivirals and non-antivirals-based\n      approaches.\n\n      CD24Fc is a biological immunomodulator in Phase II/III clinical trial stage. CD24Fc comprises\n      the nonpolymorphic regions of CD24 attached to the Fc region of human IgG1. We have shown\n      that CD24 is an innate checkpoint against the inflammatory response to tissue injuries or\n      danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Preclinical and clinical studies have\n      demonstrated that CD24Fc effectively address the major challenges associated with COVID-19.\n      First, a Phase I clinical trial on healthy volunteers not only demonstrated safety of CD24Fc,\n      but also demonstrated its biological activity in suppressing expression of multiple\n      inflammatory cytokines. Second, in Phase II clinical trial in leukemia patients undergoing\n      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT), three doses of CD24Fc effectively eliminated\n      severe (Grade 3-4) acute graft vs host diseases (GVHD), which is caused by over reacting\n      immune system and transplanted T cells attacking recipient target tissues. Third, in\n      preclinical models of HIV/SIV infections, we have shown that CD24Fc ameliorated production of\n      multiple inflammatory cytokines, reversed the loss of T lymphocytes as well as functional T\n      cell exhaustion and reduced the leukocyte infiltration of multiple organs. It is particularly\n      noteworthy that CD24Fc reduced the rate of pneumonia in SIV-infected Chinese rhesus monkey\n      from 83% to 33%. Therefore, CD24Fc maybe a prime candidate for non-antiviral biological\n      modifier for COVID-19 therapy. The phase III trial will involve 230 patients randomized into\n      blinded placebo and CD24Fc arms, with time to clinical improvement from severe to mild\n      symptom as the primary endpoint."}, "overall_status": "Not yet recruiting", "start_date": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "May 2020"}, "completion_date": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "May 2022"}, "primary_completion_date": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "May 2021"}, "phase": "Phase 3", "study_type": "Interventional", "has_expanded_access": "No", "study_design_info": {"allocation": "Randomized", "intervention_model": "Parallel Assignment", "primary_purpose": "Treatment", "masking": "Quadruple (Participant, Care Provider, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)"}, "primary_outcome": {"measure": "Improvement of COVID-19 disease status", "time_frame": "14 days", "description": "Time to improve in clinical status: the time (days) required from the start of treatment to the improvement of clinical status \"severe\" to \"moderate/mild\"; or improvement from \"scale 3 or 4\" to \"scale 5 or higher\" based on NIAID ordinal scales."}, "secondary_outcome": [{"measure": "Conversion rate of clinical status at Day 8", "time_frame": "7 days", "description": "Conversion rate of clinical status on days 8 (proportion of subjects who changed from \"severe\" to \"moderate or mild\", or the improvement from \"scale 3 or 4\" to \"scale 5 or higher\" on NIAID ordinal scale)"}, {"measure": "Conversion rate of clinical status at Day 15", "time_frame": "14 days", "description": "Conversion rate of clinical status on days 15 (proportion of subjects who changed from \"severe\" to \"moderate or mild\", or the improvement from \"scale 3 or 4\" to \"scale 5 or higher\" on NIAID ordinal scale)"}, {"measure": "Hospital discharge time", "time_frame": "14 days", "description": "The discharge time or NEWS2 (National Early Warning Score 2) of \u22642 is maintained for 24 hours"}, {"measure": "All cause of death", "time_frame": "14 days", "description": "All cause of death"}, {"measure": "Duration of mechanical ventilation", "time_frame": "14 days", "description": "Duration of mechanical ventilation (IMV, NIV) (days)"}, {"measure": "Duration of pressors", "time_frame": "14 days", "description": "Duration of pressors (days)"}, {"measure": "Duration of ECMO", "time_frame": "14 days", "description": "Duration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (days)"}, {"measure": "Duration of oxygen therapy", "time_frame": "14 days", "description": "Duration of oxygen therapy (oxygen inhalation by nasal cannula or mask) (days)"}, {"measure": "Length of hospital stay", "time_frame": "14 days", "description": "Length of hospital stay (days)"}, {"measure": "Absolute lymphocyte count", "time_frame": "14 days", "description": "Changes of absolute lymphocyte count in peripheral blood"}], "number_of_arms": "2", "enrollment": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "230"}, "condition": "Severe Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)", "arm_group": [{"arm_group_label": "CD24Fc Treatment", "arm_group_type": "Experimental", "description": "Single dose at Day 1, CD24Fc, 480mg, diluted to 100ml with normal saline, IV infusion in 60 minutes."}, {"arm_group_label": "Placebo", "arm_group_type": "Placebo Comparator", "description": "Single dose at Day 1, normal saline solution 100ml, IV infusion in 60 minutes."}], "intervention": [{"intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "CD24Fc", "description": "CD24Fc is given on Day 1.", "arm_group_label": "CD24Fc Treatment", "other_name": "Human CD24 and human IgG Fc Fusion Protein"}, {"intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Placebo", "description": "Placebo is given on Day 1.", "arm_group_label": "Placebo", "other_name": "Saline"}], "eligibility": {"criteria": {"textblock": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n          1.
