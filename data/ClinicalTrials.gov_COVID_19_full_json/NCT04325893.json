COVID-19, the disease caused by this virus,\n      has a very polymorphous clinical presentation, which ranges from isolated attacks on the\n      upper respiratory tract to acute respiratory distress syndrome. It may appear serious\n      straightaway or may develop in two stages, with a worsening condition 7 to 10 days after the\n      initial clinical signs, potentially linked to a cytokine storm in the immune system and\n      accompanied by a high risk of thrombosis. The global mortality rate of COVID-19 is understood\n      to be between 3% and 4%, with the more severe forms being more frequent among older age\n      groups. Treatment is largely symptomatic as no antiviral treatment to date has shown to be of\n      clinical benefit to this illness. Hydroxychloroquine is a derivative of chloroquine, which is\n      commonly used to treat some autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus. It is\n      active in vitro in cell models of infection by multiple viruses, such as HIV, hepatitis C and\n      SARS-CoV. However, its use in viral infections among humans has not been demonstrated.\n\n      Very recently, a non-controlled preliminary study looked into the effectiveness of\n      hydroxychloroquine on the viral excretion of subjects affected by COVID-19. Among 20 patients\n      treated with hydroxychloroquine in doses of 600 mg per day, the percentage of viral findings\n      of positive SARS-CoV-2 in the nasopharynx using RT-PCR went from 100% on inclusion (start of\n      treatment) to 43% six days later. In comparison, among the 16 patients who were not treated,\n      90% had a positive RT-PCR six days after inclusion. Furthermore, hydroxychloroquine has\n      immunomodulating and anti-inflammatory properties, which could theoretically prevent or limit\n      secondary complications.\n\n      The research hypothesis is that treatment with hydroxychloroquine improves prognosis and\n      reduces the risk of death or using an invasive artificial ventilator on patients suffering\n      from COVID-19."}, "overall_status": "Not yet recruiting", "start_date": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "April 2020"}, "completion_date": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "September 2020"}, "primary_completion_date": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "September 2020"}, "phase": "Phase 3", "study_type": "Interventional", "has_expanded_access": "No", "study_design_info": {"allocation": "Randomized", "intervention_model": "Parallel Assignment", "primary_purpose": "Treatment", "masking": "Double (Participant, Investigator)"}, "primary_outcome": {"measure": "Death, regardless of cause, or the use of intubation and invasive ventilation in the 14 days (day 14) following inclusion and the start of treatment (day 0)", "time_frame": "Day 14"}, "secondary_outcome": [{"measure": "Death, regardless of cause, or the use of intubation and invasive ventilation at day 28.", "time_frame": "Day 28"}, {"measure": "Clinical development on the OSCI scale for COVID-19 by the WHO between day 0-day 14", "time_frame": "Day 14"}, {"measure": "Clinical development on the OSCI scale for COVID-19 by the WHO between day 0-day 28", "time_frame": "Day 28"}, {"measure": "All-cause mortality at day 14", "time_frame": "Day 14"}, {"measure": "All-cause mortality at day 28", "time_frame": "Day 28"}, {"measure": "Rate of RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 with nasopharynx samples at day 5", "time_frame": "Day 5"}, {"measure": "Rate of RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 with nasopharynx samples at day 10", "time_frame": "Day 10"}, {"measure": "Rate of thrombo-phlebitis or symptomatic arterial occurrences at day 28", "time_frame": "Day 28"}], "number_of_arms": "2", "enrollment": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "1300"}, "condition": "Coronavirus", "arm_group": [{"arm_group_label": "Hydroxychloroquine", "arm_group_type": "Active Comparator"}, {"arm_group_label": "Placebo", "arm_group_type": "Placebo Comparator"}], "intervention": [{"intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Hydroxychloroquine", "description": "First dose of 400 mg will be taken immediately after inclusion at day 0, the second dose of 400 mg will be taken on the same evening and the treatment will then be continued for the following eight days at a rate of 200 mg in the morning and evening.", "arm_group_label": "Hydroxychloroquine"}, {"intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Placebo", "description": "The first dose of 400 mg will be taken immediately after inclusion at day 0, the second dose of 400 mg will be taken on the same evening and the treatment will then be continued for the following eight days at a rate of 200 mg in the morning and evening.", "arm_group_label": "Placebo"}], "eligibility": {"criteria": {"textblock": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n          -
