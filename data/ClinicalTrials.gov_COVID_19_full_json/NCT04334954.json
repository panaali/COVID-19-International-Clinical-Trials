Identifying exposures can be accomplished through\n      analysis of serum during an outbreak to identify those with specific antibodies to the\n      pathogen. The knowledge of the level of exposures could greatly impact the response to\n      current and future pandemics. In this natural history study, we will collect a single blood\n      draw from individuals to identify individuals who have anti-SARS-COV2 antibodies present\n      despite no confirmed disease or known exposures."
