The diagnosis is clinical and patients develop flu-like syndrome with\n      fever and cough; patients with clinical symptoms can perform a swab test for diagnosis of\n      positivity to Covid-19. Even if diagnosis and treatment are well described, to date, this\n      viral pandemic infection induces an increased mortality in the world. The aim of the present\n      project is to evaluate specific biomarkers that could be used for patient stratification and\n      for tailor therapy in COVID-19 infected patients."
