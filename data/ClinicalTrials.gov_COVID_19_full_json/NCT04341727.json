We\n      are primarily interested in the time to recovery. In addition to study medications there will\n      be daily symptom surveys for 14 days, then weekly thereafter for 4 weeks resulting in a total\n      duration of follow up of 42 days. During hospitalization, daily symptom surveys will be\n      completed in conjunction with the study coordinators. On discharge participants will have the\n      option to complete electronic symptom surveys or complete symptom surveys via telephone with\n      study coordinator. In the event that the participant opts for electronic symptom surveys on\n      discharge they will in addition receive a follow up call from a study coordination every 7\n      days during the initial 14 day period. In addition, failure to submit a symptom survey will\n      prompt a study follow up call. Data from SOC will be collected from medical records."
