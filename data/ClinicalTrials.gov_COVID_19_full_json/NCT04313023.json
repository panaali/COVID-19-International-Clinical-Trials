Subjects must have documented exposure to COVID-19 and have a documented negative\n             test for the virus within 72 hours of the administration of study drug\n\n          -  2. Subjects must be free of clinical symptoms (fever, cough, shortness of breath) of a\n             potential COVID-19 infection\n\n          -  3. Subjects must be under quarantine in a controlled facility or hospital (home\n             quarantine is not sufficient)\n\n          -  4. Spirometry (forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV1] and forced vital capacity\n             [FVC]) \u226570% of predicted value\n\n          -  5. If female, must be either post-menopausal (one year or greater without menses),\n             surgically sterile, or, for female subjects of child-bearing potential who are capable\n             of conception must be: practicing two effective methods of birth control (acceptable\n             methods include intrauterine device, spermicide, barrier, male partner surgical\n             sterilization, and hormonal contraception) during the study and through 30 days after\n             completion of the study. Abstinence is not classified as an effective method of birth\n             control.\n\n          -  6. If female, must not be pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or nurse a child during\n             the study and through 30 days after completion of the study. A pregnancy test must be\n             negative at the Screening Visit, prior to dosing on Day 1.\n\n          -  7. If male, must be surgically sterile or willing to practice two effective methods of\n             birth control (acceptable methods include barrier, spermicide, or female partner\n             surgical sterilization) during the study and through 30 days after completion of the\n             study. Abstinence is not classified as an effective method of birth control.\n\n          -  8. Ability to understand and give informed consent.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  1. Documented infection with COVID-19\n\n          -  2. Clinical signs and symptoms consistent with COVID-19 infection (fever, cough,\n             shortness of breath) at the time of screening\n\n          -  3. Known history of chronic pulmonary disease (e.g., asthma [including atopic asthma,\n             exercise-induced asthma, or asthma triggered by respiratory infection], chronic\n             pulmonary disease, pulmonary fibrosis, COPD), pulmonary hypertension, or heart\n             failure.\n\n          -  4. Any condition which, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, would prevent\n             full participation in this trial or would interfere with the evaluation of the trial\n             endpoints.\n\n          -  5.
