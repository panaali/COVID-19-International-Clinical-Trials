            "textblock": "Background: There are no proven therapies specific for Covid-19. The full spectrum of\n      Covid-19 ranges from asymptomatic disease to mild respiratory tract illness to severe\n      pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiorgan failure, and death. The\n      efficacy of corticosteroids in viral ARDS remains controversial.\n\n      Methods: This is an internationally (Spain, Canada, China, USA) designed multicenter,\n      randomized, controlled, open-label clinical trial testing dexamethasone in mechanically\n      ventilated adult patients with established moderate-to-severe ARDS caused by confirmed\n      Covid-19 infection, admitted in a network of Spanish ICUs. Eligible patients will be randomly\n      assigned to receive either dexamethasone plus standard intensive care, or standard intensive\n      care alone. Patients in the dexamethasone group will receive an intravenous dose of 20 mg\n      once daily from day 1 to day 5, followed by 10 mg once daily from day 6 to day 10. The\n      primary outcome is 60-day mortality. The secondary outcome is the number of ventilator-free\n      days at 28 days. All analyses will be done according to the intention-to-treat principle."

            "textblock": "The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a catastrophic illness of multifactorial\n      etiology characterized by a diffuse, severe inflammatory process of the lung leading to acute\n      hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation (MV). Pulmonary infections are\n      the leading causes of ARDS. Clinical and experimental research has established a strong\n      association between dysregulated systemic and pulmonary inflammation and progression or\n      delayed resolution of ARDS.\n\n      The COVID-19 pandemic is a critical moment for the world. Severe pneumonia is the main\n      condition leading to ARDS requiring weeks of MV with high mortality (40-60%) in COVID-19\n      patients. There is no specific therapy for Covid-19, although patients are receiving drugs\n      that are already approved for treating other diseases. There has been great interest in the\n      role of corticosteroids to attenuate the pulmonary and systemic damage in ARDS patients\n      because of their potent anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic properties. However, the efficacy\n      of corticosteroids in viral ARDS remains controversial.\n\n      We justify the need of this study based on the positive results of a recent clinical trial by\n      our group, showing that dexamethasone for 10 days was able to reduce the duration of\n      mechanical ventilation (MV) and increase hospital survival in patients with ARDS from\n      multiple causes (Villar J et al. Lancet Respir Med 2020). Dexamethasone has never been\n      evaluated in viral ARDS in a randomized controlled fashion. Our goal in this study is to\n      examine the effects of dexamethasone on hospital mortality and on ventilator-free days in\n      patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS due to confirmed COVID-19 infection admitted into a\n      network of Spanish intensive care units (ICUs)."
