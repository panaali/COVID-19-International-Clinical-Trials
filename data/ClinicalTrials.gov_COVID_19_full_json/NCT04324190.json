We intend to evaluate an online support program aiming at reducing stress in the\n      context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The program consists of twelve modules that participants\n      undergo, covering a broad range of topics related to stress in the context of the COVID-19\n      pandemic. It has been developed together with and is provided by Selfapy GmbH, Berlin. The\n      aim of this randomised clinical trial with observational components is to estimate the\n      effects of the intervention as a whole, as well as individual modules and selected chapters.\n      Further, follow-up assessments as well as information on risks and the long-term course of\n      COVID pandemic-related stress may help to elucidate COVID-19 pandemic stress across time and\n      what we can do to prevent long-term negative consequences."}, "detailed_description": {"textblock": "The overall aim of this randomised trial with observational component is to estimate the\n      effects of a guided digital online support program to increase mental health and reduce\n      psychosocial stress in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
