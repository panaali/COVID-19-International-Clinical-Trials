We will employ a randomized, double\n      blind, placebo-controlled study design. 30 subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 fashion to\n      receive sirolimus or placebo. Sirolimus will be given as a 6mg oral loading dose on day 1\n      followed by 2mg daily for a maximum treatment duration of 14 days or until hospital\n      discharge, whichever happens sooner. Chart reviews will be conducted daily to determine\n      changes in clinical status, concomitant medications and laboratory parameters. Study specific\n      biomarkers will be measured at baseline and then at days 3, 7 and 14."
