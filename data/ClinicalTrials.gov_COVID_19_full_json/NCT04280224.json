There is no confirmed antivirus\n      therapy for 2019-nCoV infection. Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes that may\n      serve as useful effectors against danger infection. The purpose of this clinical\n      investigation is to evaluate the safety and efficiency of NK Cells in combination with\n      standard therapy for pneumonia patients infected with 2019-nCoV."
