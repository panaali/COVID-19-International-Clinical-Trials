Baricitinib, an anti-Janus kinase inhibitor (anti-JAK) acting against\n      JAK1 and JAK2. The drug was found capable to reduce or interrupt the passage of the virus\n      into target cells, and to inhibit the JAK1- and JAK2-mediated cytokine release. The drug was\n      licensed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis at the daily dose of 4 mg/orally, with\n      excellent results in terms of clinical response and a good safety profile. Since baricitinib\n      does not interact with antivirals due to its prevalent renal elimination, it may be used in\n      combination.The evidence on the advantageous action of baricitinib on viral entry and\n      cytokine outbreak constituted the rationale to perform a trial on patients with mild to\n      moderate COVID-19 infection receiving baricitinib combined with antiviral therapy."}, "detailed_description": {"textblock": "Study design.
