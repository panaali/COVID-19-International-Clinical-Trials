The infection affects all ages of life, although affecting\n      children in a very small proportion of cases. The typical presentation of the disease\n      combines fever (98%), cough (76%), myalgia and asthenia (18%) as well as leukopenia (25%) and\n      lymphopenia (63%). Upper airway involvement rare.\n\n      The main clinical presentation requiring hospitalization of infected patients is that of\n      atypical pneumonia which may require critical care management (27%), and progress to an acute\n      respiratory distress syndrome (67%) involving life-threatening conditions in almost 25% of\n      patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Other organ damage have been reported, mainly\n      concerning kidney damage (29%) which may require renal replacement therapy in approximately\n      17% of patients.\n\n      Neurological damage has been very rarely studied, yet reported in 36% of cases in a study\n      including patients of varying severity.\n\n      Finally, the mortality associated with this emerging virus is high in patients for whom\n      critical care management is necessary, reported in 62% of patients.\n\n      We therefore propose a prospective observational study which aim at reporting the prevalence\n      of acute encephalopathy at initial management in Critical/Intensive care or Neurocritical\n      care , to report its morbidity and mortality and to identify prognostic factors."}, "detailed_description": {"textblock": "All patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and acute encephalopathy at presentation will be\n      prospectively included in the NEURO-COVD-19 study.

The term acute encephalopathy refers to a rapidly developing (over less than 4 weeks, but\n      usually within hours to a few days) pathobiological process in the brain. This is a preferred\n      term 2. Acute encephalopathy can lead to a clinical presentation of subsyndromal delirium,\n      delirium, or in case of a severely decreased level of consciousness, coma; all representing a\n      change from baseline cognitive status 3. The term delirium refers to a clinical state\n      characterized by a combination of features defined by diagnostic systems such as the DSM-5.\n      Delirium according to the DSM-5 is defined if criterium A-E are fulfilled: A. Disturbance in\n      attention (i.e., reduced ability to direct, focus, sustain, and shift attention) and\n      awareness (reduced orientation to the environment). B. The disturbance develops over a short\n      period of time (usually hours to a few days) represents a change from baseline attention and\n      awareness, and tends to fluctuate in severity during the course of the day. C. An additional\n      disturbance in cognition (e.g., memory deficit, disorientation, language, visuospatial\n      ability, or perception). D. The disturbances in criteria A and C are not explained by another\n      pre-existing, established, or evolving neurocognitive disorder, and do not occur in the\n      context of a severely reduced level of arousal, such as coma. E. There is evidence from the\n      history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that the disturbance is a direct\n      physiologic consequence of another medical condition, substance intoxication or withdrawal\n      (i.e. because of a drug of abuse medication), or exposure to a toxin, or is because of\n      multiple etiologies. \" (Slooter, A.J.C., Otte, W.M., Devlin, J.W. et al.
