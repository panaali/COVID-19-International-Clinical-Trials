(1,2) The exacerbated\n      inflammatory response in COVID-19 infected critically ill patients calls for appropriate anti\n      inflammatory therapeutics combined with antiviral effects. Thus, drugs combining\n      anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects may reduce the symptoms of respiratory distress\n      caused by COVID-19. This dual effect may simultaneously protect severely ill patients and\n      reduce the viral load, therefore limiting virus dissemination. Naproxen, an approved\n      anti-inflammatory drug, is an inhibitor of both cyclo oxygenase (COX-2) and of Influenza A\n      virus nucleoprotein (NP). The NP of Coronavirus (CoV), positive-sense single-stranded\n      viruses, share with negative-sense single-stranded viruses as Influenza the ability to bind\n      to- and protect genomic RNA by forming self-associated oligomers in a helical structure with\n      RNA. Naproxen was shown to bind the Influenza A virus NP making electrostatic and hydrophobic\n      interactions with conserved residues of the RNA binding groove and C terminal domain. (3)\n      Consequently, naproxen binding competed with NP association with viral RNA and impeded the NP\n      self-association process which strongly reduced viral transcription/replication. This drug\n      may have the potential to present antiviral properties against SARS-CoV-2 suggested by\n      modelling work based on the structures of CoV NP. The high sequence conservation within the\n      coronavirus family, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and the present\n      SARSCoV-2 coronavirus allows to perform this comparison. (4) A recent clinical trial shown\n      that the combination of clarithromycin, naproxen and oseltamivir reduced mortality of\n      patients hospitalized for H3N2 Influenza infection. (5). Inappropriate inflammatory response\n      in CODIV-19 patients was demonstrated in a recent study where Intensive Care Unit (ICU)\n      patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?\n      compared with non-ICU patients.(2) We suggest that naproxen could combine a broad-spectrum\n      antiviral activity with its well-known anti inflammatory action that could help reducing\n      severe respiratory mortality associated with COVID-19."}, "overall_status": "Not yet recruiting", "start_date": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "March 27, 2020"}, "completion_date": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "June 27, 2021"}, "primary_completion_date": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "April 27, 2021"}, "phase": "Phase 3", "study_type": "Interventional", "has_expanded_access": "No", "study_design_info": {"allocation": "Randomized", "intervention_model": "Parallel Assignment", "primary_purpose": "Treatment", "masking": "None (Open Label)"}, "primary_outcome": {"measure": "Mortality all causes at day30", "time_frame": "at day30"}, "secondary_outcome": [{"measure": "Number of days alive free of mechanical ventilation", "time_frame": "during 30 days after randomization"}, {"measure": "Number of days alive outside", "time_frame": "during 30 days after randomization"}, {"measure": "Number of days alive outside hospital", "time_frame": "during 30 days after randomization"}, {"measure": "Maximal changes in Sofa score", "time_frame": "in the first 7 days after randomization"}, {"measure": "Time to negativation of virus titer in the nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA)", "time_frame": "during 90 days after randomization"}], "number_of_arms": "2", "enrollment": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "584"}, "condition": "COVID-19", "arm_group": [{"arm_group_label": "1: Naproxen", "arm_group_type": "Experimental", "description": "Administration of naproxen 250 mg twice and lansoprazole 30 mg daily for prevention of gastropathy induced by stress or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) in addition to standard of care (SOC)"}, {"arm_group_label": "2: Standard of care", "arm_group_type": "Placebo Comparator", "description": "Standard of care"}], "intervention": [{"intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "1: Naproxen", "description": "Description : Administration of naproxen 250 mg twice and lansoprazole 30 mg daily for prevention of gastropathy induced by stress or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) in addition to standard of care (SOC)", "arm_group_label": "1: Naproxen"}, {"intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "2: Standard of care", "description": "Standard of care", "arm_group_label": ["1: Naproxen", "2: Standard of care"]}], "eligibility": {"criteria": {"textblock": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  COVID-19 infected patient\n\n          -  Age 18 years or older\n\n          -  Presence of pneumonia\n\n          -  PaO2/FiO2 < 300 mm Hg or SpO2 < 93% in air ambient or need to supplementary oxygen\n             administration in order to maintain SpO2 range in [94-98%] or lung infiltrates > 50%\n\n          -  Medical insurance\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Presence of do-not-resuscitate order\n\n          -  Pregnancy\n\n          -  Prisoners\n\n          -  Known Naproxen allergy or intolerance\n\n          -  Severe renal failure"}, "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No"}, "overall_official": {"last_name": "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric ADNET, MD, PhD", "role": "Principal Investigator", "affiliation": "Assistance Publique - H\u00f4pitaux de Paris"}, "overall_contact": {"last_name": "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric ADNET, MD, PhD", "phone": "+33 1-48-96-44-08", "email": "frederic.adnet@aphp.fr"}, "overall_contact_backup": {"last_name": "Anny SLAMA SCHWOK, MD", "email": "anny.slama-schwok@inserm.fr"}, "verification_date": "March 2020", "study_first_submitted": "March 26, 2020", "study_first_submitted_qc": "March 26, 2020", "study_first_posted": {"@type": "Actual", "#text": "March 27, 2020"}, "last_update_submitted": "March 26, 2020", "last_update_submitted_qc": "March 26, 2020", "last_update_posted": {"@type": "Actual", "#text": "March 27, 2020"}, "responsible_party": {"responsible_party_type": "Sponsor"}, "keyword": ["COVID-19", "SARS-COV-2", "Naproxen", "Nonsteroidal anti-inflamatory drug"], "condition_browse": {"mesh_term": "Critical Illness"}, "intervention_browse": {"mesh_term": "Naproxen"}}}
