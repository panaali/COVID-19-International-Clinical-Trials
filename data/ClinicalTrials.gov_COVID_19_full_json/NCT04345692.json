Death\n\n      After enrollment and randomization there will be baseline and then daily assessments of\n      clinical status and test results and procedures during hospitalization. Course of HCQ\n      treatment is 5 days. Participants are followed daily during hospitalization. All procedures,\n      evaluations and treatment, including the hydroxychloroquine laboratory tests, and radiology\n      tests are part of the usual clinical care for COVID-19 patients. This study will only collect\n      the information obtained as part of hospital standard of care. If the information is not\n      available, it will not be obtained by any other mechanism. After discharge there is a follow\n      up telephone call at day 15 and day 28. Follow-up assessment includes any clinical events,\n      adverse events, and clinic or emergency visits or hospitalizations. Participants in the HCQ\n      arm have safety labs: CBC and Comprehensive Metabolic profile scheduled on day 7 and 14."
