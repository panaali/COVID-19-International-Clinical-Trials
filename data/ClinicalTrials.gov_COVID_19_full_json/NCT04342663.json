Fluvoxamine is an anti-depressant drug approved by the FDA for the\n      treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder. The use of fluvoxamine for the treatment of\n      COVID-19 is considered investigational, which means the US Food and Drug Administration has\n      not approved it for this use.\n\n      This study is fully-remote, which means that there is no face-to-face contact; study\n      materials including study drug will be shipped to participants' houses. Only residents of\n      Missouri and Illinois may participate."

            "textblock": "We will consent approximately 152 participants, age 18 and older, who have tested tested\n      positive for COVID-19 and are currently experiencing mild symptoms. All interactions for this\n      study will be conducted remotely by videoconferencing, email, or phone.\n\n      Screening: All participants will first complete a pre-screen to see if they may be eligible\n      for the study. Once a participant is confirmed eligible and consented, the study team will\n      send the study materials. These materials will consist of study medication and\n      self-monitoring equipment, including a pregnancy test (for females of childbearing age not\n      using contraception), an oxygen saturation monitor, blood pressure monitor, and thermometer.\n      Once the study team has finalized the screening process, the participant will begin taking\n      the study medication.\n\n      RCT: Participants will be randomly assigned (1:1) to take either fluvoxamine or a placebo.\n      This phase of the study will last approximately 15 days and is double-blinded. Participants\n      will take 100mg of fluvoxamine or placebo by mouth three times a day for a daily total of\n      300mg. They will continue this dose for approximately 15 days. Depending on tolerability, the\n      dose may be adjusted. Participants will also complete short 10-15 minute assessments daily to\n      assess symptoms, results of self-monitoring (including oxygen level, blood pressure, and\n      temperature) and any adverse events.\n\n      Open-label Phase: After completing the randomization phase, participants will then\n      participate in an open-label phase (participant will definitely receive fluvoxamine) that\n      will last up to 15 days. Those randomized to placebo will have the opportunity to try\n      fluvoxamine during this time. Those randomized to fluvoxamine will continue this medication\n      while slowly decreasing the drug. The participant may opt out of this phase. The dosage\n      during this time will be 50-100mg two times daily until discontinuing the drug. Participants\n      will also continue completing short 10-15 minute daily assessments to assess physical\n      symptoms, vitals, and any adverse events.\n\n      Follow-up Phase: We will follow participants for approximately 30 days after the end of the\n      randomized phase. During this time, they may continue to complete daily study assessments to\n      monitor physical symptoms, vitals, and adverse events. If needed, the study team will review\n      medical records to determine the clinical course of participants."
