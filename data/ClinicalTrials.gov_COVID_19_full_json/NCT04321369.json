Leveraging our presence in the Seattle/Puget Sound area with Everett\n      Clinic, we intend to develop a model that can screen a large number of patients at varying\n      levels of risk and manifestation of clinical symptoms while conserving personal protective\n      equipment (PPE) and decreasing transmission risk to health care workers. This will also serve\n      to support the enterprise and public health response. Towards this goal, we must first assess\n      the equivalence between clinician-collected nasopharyngeal (NP) samples to patient-collected\n      tongue, nasal, and mid-turbinate (MT) samples to detect SARS-CoV-2 across a broad\n      cross-section of the population."
