In this study, estimated total\n      of 120-240 male and female patients who have been diagnosed with non-critical type of\n      coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) will be enrolled and randomly assigned to one of two study\n      groups, the T89 treatment group and the blank control group, to T89 or nothing on the base of\n      a recommended standard treatment for up to 14 days . The primary efficacy parameters include\n      the time to oxygen saturation recovery to normal level (\u226597%), the proportion of patients\n      with normal level of oxygen saturation after treatment, and the total duration of oxygen\n      inhalation, oxygen flow change by time, oxygen concentration change by time during treatment."

            "textblock": "The breakout of a new type of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) begun in Wuhan of Hubei province in\n      China in December 2019, and as a result of its rapid spreading nationwide, as of February 16,\n      2020, a large number of people up to 68,500 totally in China were diagnosed with a new type\n      of disease of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and 1665 peoples were died due to this\n      disease in China. Based on the recent epidemiological investigation, the incubation period of\n      this new coronavirus is 1-14 days and 3-7 days for most people before they show any symptom,\n      such as fever, fatigue and dry cough that are the main clinical symptoms a few patients will\n      also show nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat and diarrhea and other symptoms. Severe\n      patients often have dyspnea and/or hypoxemia 1 week after onset of the disease, and the rapid\n      progression for these patients include acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock,\n      refractory metabolic acidosis and coagulation dysfunction.\n\n      According to the \"Guidance of Diagnosis and Treatment for Patients with Coronavirus Disease\n      2019 (COVID-19) (Procedural Version 5 Amendment)\" recently issued by National Health\n      Commission of the People's Republic of China, the general treatment will include close\n      monitoring vital signs and oxygen saturation at finger, additionally, monitoring routine\n      blood test, routine urine test, coagulation function, arterial blood gas analysis based on\n      individual condition, and providing effective oxygen inhalation treatment (including nasal\n      catheter, mask oxygen supply and transnasal high flow oxygen therapy) in time.\n\n      T89 have the effects of activating blood circulation and removing blood stasis, regulating Qi\n      and relieving pain. Four clinical trials conducted in China and abroad have shown that T89\n      can effectively alleviate the clinical symptoms of acute high altitude reaction, improve\n      blood oxygen saturation, significantly increase the exercise time in treadmill and metabolic\n      equivalents of task and enhance exercise tolerance under hypoxic environment. Modern\n      pharmacological and gene network-based studies have shown that T89 can improve the oxygen\n      carrying capacity of red blood cells, increase oxygen saturation, effectively reduce the\n      injury of major organs such as heart, brain, lung and kidney caused by hypoxia, and prevent\n      the decrease of oxygen saturation by improving the energy metabolism disorder caused by\n      hypoxia. At the same time, T89 can inhibit the reduction of hematocrit, albumin leakage,\n      neutrophil CD18 and adhesion factor of endothelial cells (ICAM-1), by which T89 has a good\n      therapeutic effect on microcirculation disorders caused by many diseases.\n\n      In conclusion, T89 can improve the ability of carrying oxygen of red blood cells, increase\n      the oxygen saturation, effectively reduce the injury of heart, brain, lung and kidney and\n      other major organs caused by hypoxia, and it can significantly improve the microcirculation\n      disorder. At the same time, in the \"Guidance for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious\n      Atypical Pneumonia (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndromes, SARS) P (2003 edition)\" has also\n      recommended T89 can be used as a traditional Chinese patent medicine to treat patients of\n      advanced stage and severe SARS lung asthma syndrome by its effect of promoting blood\n      circulation and removing blood stasis. In conclusion, T89 can improve the oxygen saturation\n      and the clinical symptoms of patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), as a result,\n      there may be some benefits for these patients to use T89 in current clinical treatment.\n\n      This exploratory treatment clinical study is to investigate the effect of T89 on improving\n      oxygen saturation and clinical symptoms in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),\n      with the study design characterized by open-label, randomized and blank-control. In this\n      study, an estimated total of 120-240 male and female patients aged 18-85 years old who have\n      been diagnosed with coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19), not including critical type in\n      severity, will be enrolled and randomly assigned to one of two study groups, the T89\n      treatment group and the blank control group, to receive T89 or nothing for up to 14 days on\n      the base of a standard treatment recommended by the\"Guidance of Diagnosis and Treatment for\n      Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) (Procedural Version 5 Amendment) .\n\n      As planned, this study will be started before March 2020 in hospitals located in Wuhan of\n      Hubei province in China and completed at the end of next June 2020."
