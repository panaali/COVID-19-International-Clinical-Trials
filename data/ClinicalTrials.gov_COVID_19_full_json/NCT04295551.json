            "textblock": "In December 2019, Wuhan, in Hubei province, China, became the center of an outbreak of\n      pneumonia of unknown cause. In a short time, Chinese scientists had shared the genome\n      information of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from these pneumonia patients and developed a\n      real-time reverse transcription PCR (real time RT-PCR) diagnostic assay.\n\n      In view of the fact that there is currently no effective antiviral therapy, the prevention or\n      treatment of lung injury caused by COVID-19 can be an alternative target for current\n      treatment. Xiyanping injection has anti-inflammatory and immune regulation effects. This\n      study is a Randomized, Parallel Controlled Clinical Study to treat patients with COVID-19\n      infection."

There is a clear difference from MERSr-COV.\n      Since December 2019, Wuhan City, Hubei Province has successively found multiple cases of\n      patients with pneumonia infected by a new type of coronavirus. With the spread of the\n      epidemic, as of 12:00 on February 12, 2020, a total of 44726 confirmed cases nationwide\n      (Hubei Province) 33,366 cases, accounting for 74.6%), with 1,114 deaths (1068 cases in Hubei\n      Province), and a mortality rate of 2.49% (3.20% in Hubei Province).\n\n      In view of the fact that there is currently no effective antiviral therapy, the prevention or\n      treatment of lung injury caused by COVID-19 can be an alternative target for current\n      treatment.

In the\n      early clinical practice of treating severe H1N1, it was clinically concerned, and combined\n      with conventional treatment, and achieved good results."
