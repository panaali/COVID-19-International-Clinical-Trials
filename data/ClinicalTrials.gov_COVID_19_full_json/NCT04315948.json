Adults (\u226518 year-old) hospitalized for COVID-19 with SpO2 \u2264 94% on room air OR acute\n      respiratory failure requiring supplemental oxygen or ventilatory support will be randomized\n      between 4 treatment arms, each to be given in addition to the usual standard of care (SoC) in\n      the participating hospital: SoC alone versus SoC + Remdesivir versus SoC +\n      Lopinavir/Ritonavir versus SoC + Lopinavir/Ritonavir plus interferon \u00df-1a versus SoC +\n      Hydroxychloroquine. Randomization will be stratified by European region and severity of\n      illness at enrollment (moderate disease: patients NOT requiring non-invasive ventilation NOR\n      high flow oxygen devices NOR invasive mechanical ventilation NOR ECMO and severe disease:\n      patients requiring non-invasive ventilation OR high flow oxygen devices OR invasive\n      mechanical ventilation OR ECMO). The interim trial results will be monitored by a Data\n      Monitoring Committee, and if at any stage evidence emerges that any one treatment arm is\n      definitely inferior then it will be centrally decided that that arm will be discontinued.\n      Conversely, if good evidence emerges while the trial is continuing that some other\n      treatment(s) should also be being evaluated then it will be centrally decided that one or\n      more extra arms will be added while the trial is in progress. The primary objective of the\n      study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of different investigational\n      therapeutics relative to the control arm in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, the primary\n      endpoint is the subject clinical status (on a 7-point ordinal scale) at day 15."
