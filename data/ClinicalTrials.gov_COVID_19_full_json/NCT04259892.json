In a few weeks, the number of confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infection has\n      dramatically increased, with almost 20'000 cases and more than 400 reported deaths on\n      January, 31st 2020.\n\n      Little is known on the rate of human-to-human transmission of this new coronavirus 2019-nCoV.\n      In France, subjects with contact considered to be at high or moderate risk of viral\n      transmission with a laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV case are being isolated at their home for\n      14 days and followed up by Sant\u00e9 Publique France or the Agence R\u00e9gionale de Sant\u00e9. Whether\n      such subjects become spreaders of the virus, nor is the proportion of viral spreader who will\n      develop a symptomatic infection.\n\n      In this study, the investigators aim to evaluate the virological and clinical outcomes of\n      subjects following a contact at high/moderate risk of 2019-nCoV transmission.\n\n      The study population is represented by all subjects who had a contact with\n      laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV cases and whose contact was considered to be at high/moderate\n      risk of 2019-nCoV transmission, as defined with precise criteria emitted by the Health\n      Ministry and Sant\u00e9 Publique France.\n\n      Procedures added by the research:\n\n      Nasopharyngeal swabs for determination of the presence of 2019-nCoV detected by Polymerase\n      Chain Reaction (PCR).\n\n      Blood sampling for determination of the presence of 2019-nCoV type M immunoglobulins or type\n      G immunoglobulins by microneutralisation technique."}, "overall_status": "Recruiting", "start_date": {"@type": "Actual", "#text": "February 4, 2020"}, "completion_date": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "February 4, 2021"}, "primary_completion_date": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "October 4, 2020"}, "study_type": "Observational", "has_expanded_access": "No", "study_design_info": {"observational_model": "Cohort", "time_perspective": "Prospective"}, "primary_outcome": {"measure": "Number of Participants with presence of 2019-nCoV in at least one of nasopharyngeal swab", "time_frame": "14 days", "description": "PCR"}, "secondary_outcome": [{"measure": "For each participant, time (days) between the last contact with the laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV case and the first positive PCR", "time_frame": "14 days", "description": "PCR"}, {"measure": "For each participant, time (days) between the first positive PCR and the first negative PCR", "time_frame": "14 days", "description": "PCR"}, {"measure": "Number of Participants with presence of at least one of the following symptoms: fever > 38\u00b0C, asthenia/fatigue/malaise, headache, thrills/sweating, myalgia/aches, cough, dyspnea, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, diarrhe", "time_frame": "14 days", "description": "Patient Reported Outcome"}, {"measure": "Number of Participants with positive serology in the 90 days following last contact", "time_frame": "90 days", "description": "microneutralisation assay"}], "enrollment": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "300"}, "condition": "Coronavirus", "intervention": {"intervention_type": "Biological", "intervention_name": "2019-nCoV PCR", "description": "Nasopharyngeal swabs"}, "biospec_retention": "Samples Without DNA", "biospec_descr": {"textblock": "Nasopharyngeal swabs"}, "eligibility": {"study_pop": {"textblock": "The study population is represented by all subjects who had a contact with\n        laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV cases and whose contact was considered to be at\n        high/moderate risk of 2019-nCoV transmission, as defined with precise criteria emitted by\n        the Health Ministry and Sant\u00e9 Publique France."}, "sampling_method": "Non-Probability Sample", "criteria": {"textblock": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n          -
