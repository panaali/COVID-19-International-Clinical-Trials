Long incubation period (average 5-7 days, up to 28 days), and the incubation period is\n           contagious\n\n        2. Strong transmissibility, virus can be transmitted through aerosol\n\n        3. Difficulty distinguishing infected patients from other pathogenic infections\n\n        4. High negative rate of nucleic acid detection in upper respiratory tract samples of\n           infected patients, which increases the difficulty of differential diagnosis of infection\n           with other pathogens The existing RT-PCR nucleic acid detection kits for SARS-CoV-2 has\n           two major problems. First, the procedure is not automated leading to higher requirements\n           for personnel operation level and environment sterilize. What's more the kits are\n           SARS-CoV-2 only. Once the test result is negative, it cannot help diagnose the exact\n           pathogen in one time of experiment.\n\n      Therefore, this project intends to independently develop a fully enclosed rapid detection\n      system for a total of 22 pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, on the basis of the QIAstat-Dx\n      fully automatic multiple PCR detection platform.
