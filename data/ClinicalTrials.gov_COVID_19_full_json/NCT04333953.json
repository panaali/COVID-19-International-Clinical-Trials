People with HIV (PWH)/AIDS, or people with HIV who have not achieved viral\n      suppression through antiretroviral treatment may have at higher risk for SARS-CoV-2\n      infections and disease progression. At present there is no evidence to suggest that there is\n      an increased risk of infection and increased severity of illness for PWH. We know that during\n      the SARS and MERS outbreaks, there were only few case reports of mild disease among PWH.\n      Current clinical data suggest the main mortality risk factors are linked to older age and\n      other co-morbidities.
