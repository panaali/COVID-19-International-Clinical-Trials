Baricitinib is FDA-approved for\n      the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune condition. This study intends to define\n      the impact of baricitinib on the severity and progression of COVID-19. This drug might to\n      lower the hyperinflammation caused by the virus, which would prevent damage to the lungs and\n      possibly other organs.\n\n      The study will recruit patients who have been diagnosed with COVID-19.\n\n      The goal is to recruit 80 patients."

Both phases are single arm, open label, and occur at a single site at\n      the University of Colorado Hospital (UCH). Data from participants in this study will be\n      compared with data from other COVID-19 patients not receiving baricitinib. Study participants\n      will receive 2 mg/day of baricitinib for 14 days and will be followed for up to 29 days."

Phase 3 consists of a single-arm, open-label assignment of 60 additional participants receiving baricitinib at the same dose. In both phases, participants will be monitored daily while hospitalized for 29 days, or until discharge, whichever occurs first. Participants who are discharged will be followed up with via phone on Day 15 and Day 29."
