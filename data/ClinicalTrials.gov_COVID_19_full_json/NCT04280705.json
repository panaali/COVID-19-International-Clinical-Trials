The study is a multicenter trial that will be conducted in up to approximately 75\n      sites globally. The study will compare different investigational therapeutic agents to a\n      control arm. There will be interim monitoring to introduce new arms and allow early stopping\n      for futility, efficacy, or safety. If one therapy proves to be efficacious, then this\n      treatment may become the control arm for comparison(s) with new experimental treatment(s).\n      Any such change would be accompanied by an updated sample size. Because background standards\n      of supportive care may evolve/improve over time as more is learned about successful\n      management of COVID-19, comparisons of safety and efficacy will be based on data from\n      concurrently randomized subjects. An independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) will\n      actively monitor interim data to make recommendations about early study closure or changes to\n      study arms. Subjects will be assessed daily while hospitalized. Discharged subjects will be\n      asked to attend study visits at Days 15 and 29. All subjects will undergo a series of\n      efficacy, safety, and laboratory assessments. The primary objective of the study is to\n      evaluate the clinical efficacy of different investigational therapeutics relative to the\n      control arm in adults hospitalized with COVID-19."
