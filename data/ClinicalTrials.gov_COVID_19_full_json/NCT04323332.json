This\n      may attribute to the excessive immune response caused by cytokine storm. Strategies based on\n      anti-virus drugs and treatments against symptoms have now been employed. However, these\n      managements can't effectively treat the lethal lung injury and uncontrolled immune responses,\n      especially in the elderly with severe COVID-19. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), which\n      treats the disease from anther perspective, has achieved satisfactory results.
