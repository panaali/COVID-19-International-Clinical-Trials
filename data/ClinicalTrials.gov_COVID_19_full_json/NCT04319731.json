Past use of human amniotic\n      products (i.e., membrane and fluid) is FDA-approved for tissue injury and has been used to\n      reduce inflammation and fibrosis in patients with a variety of medical conditions. We\n      hypothesize that using nebulized and/or intravenous purified (acellular) amniotic fluid will\n      reduce both inflammation in patients hospitalized for in SARS CoV-2 (COVID19)-associated\n      respiratory failure, potentially leading to a decrease in respiratory support."
