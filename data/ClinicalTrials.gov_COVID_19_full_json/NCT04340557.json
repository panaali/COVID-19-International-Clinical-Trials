Based on previous animal studies, the\n      researchers hypothesize that the addition of an ARB is beneficial in abating acute lung\n      injury in subjects in early stages of SARS-CoV-2 viral induced hypoxia."

The goal of this study is to identify whether or not ARBs\n      have an impact on inhibiting the progression to respiratory failure requiring mechanical\n      ventilation in patients with mild to moderate hypoxia in the setting of COVID-19. The\n      addition of an ARB to the standard of care treatment for these patients may be beneficial in\n      abating acute lung injury in patients in early stages of SARSCoV-2 induced hypoxia."
