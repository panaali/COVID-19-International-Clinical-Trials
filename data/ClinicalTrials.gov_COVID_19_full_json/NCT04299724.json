Some patients rapidly progressed and suffered severe acute\n      respiratory failure and died, making it imperative to develop a safe and effective vaccine to\n      treat and prevent severe Covid-19 pneumonia. Based on detailed analysis of the viral genome\n      and search for potential immunogenic targets, a synthetic minigene has been engineered based\n      on conserved domains of the viral structural proteins and a polyprotein protease. The\n      infection of Covid-19 is mediated through binding of the Spike protein to the ACEII receptor,\n      and the viral replication depends on molecular mechanisms of all of these viral proteins.\n      This trial proposes to develop universal vaccine and test innovative Covid-19 minigenes\n      engineered based on multiple viral genes, using an efficient lentiviral vector system\n      (NHP/TYF) to express viral proteins and immune modulatory genes to modify artificial antigen\n      presenting cells (aAPC) and to activate T cells. In this study, the safety and immune\n      reactivity of this aAPC vaccine will be investigated."}, "detailed_description": {"textblock": "Background:\n\n      The 2019 discovered new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is an enveloped positive strand single\n      strand RNA virus. The number of SARS-CoV-2 infected people has increased rapidly and WHO has\n      warned that the pandemic spread of Covid-19 is imminent and would have disastrous outcomes.\n      Covid-19 could pose a serious threat to human health and the global economy. There is no\n      vaccine available or clinically approved antiviral therapy as yet. This study aims to\n      evaluate the safety and immune reactivity of a genetically modified aAPC universal vaccine to\n      treat and prevent Covid-19.\n\n      Objective:\n\n      Primary study objectives: Injection of Covid-19/aAPC vaccine to volunteers to evaluate the\n      safety.\n\n      Secondary study objectives: To evaluate the anti- Covid-19 reactivity of the Covid-19/aAPC\n      vaccine.\n\n      Design:\n\n        1. Based on the genomic sequence of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, select conserved and\n           critical structural and protease protein domains to engineer lentiviral minigenes to\n           express SARS-CoV-2 antigens.\n\n        2. The Covid-19/aAPC vaccine is prepared by applying lentivirus modification including\n           immune modulatory genes and the viral minigenes, to the artificial antigen presenting\n           cells (aAPCs). The Covid-19/aAPCs are then inactivated for proliferation and extensively\n           safety tested.\n\n        3.
