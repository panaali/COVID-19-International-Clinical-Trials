Of note, in\n      the current status of a worldwide pandemic for which we have no approved vaccines or drugs,\n      for the purpose of this trial SOC would also accept any drugs that are being used in clinical\n      practice (e.g. lopinavir/ritonavir; darunavir/cobicistat; hydroxy/chloroquine, tocilizumab,\n      etc.), other than those used as part of another clinical trial.\n\n      The study is planned with a sequential design. Interim analyses: comprehensive safety data\n      monitoring analyses will be conducted when 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% of patients, or at the\n      discretionary DSMB criteria when needed. A DSMB charter will be set before the trial\n      initiation where criteria for prematurely stopping the trial due to safety issues will be\n      set.
