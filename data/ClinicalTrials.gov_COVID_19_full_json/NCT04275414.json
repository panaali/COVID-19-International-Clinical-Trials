Pulmonary edema is one of the most\n      detrimental symptoms and usually presents in severe and critical coronavirus disease\n      (COVID-19), resulting in dyspnea, acute lung injury (ALI) ,acute respiratory distress\n      syndrome (ARDS), and even death. Recent evidence revealed higher levels of blood Vascular\n      Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) in COVID-19 patients compared with healthy controls. VEGF is\n      considered as the most potent vascular permeability inducers. Numerous studies have revealed\n      that VEGF was a key factor and a potential therapeutic target in ALI and ARDS. Bevacizumab,\n      an anti-VEGF drug, approved by the FDA on February 26, 2004 and widely used in clinical\n      oncotherapy, is a promising drug for ALI/ARDS in COVID-19 through suppression of pulmonary\n      edema."

            "textblock": "In December 2019, a new identified coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak in Wuhan, causes public\n      health crisis in China and spreads worldwide. On February 11,2020, the World Health\n      Organization officially named the disease caused by the new coronavirus \"COVID-19\". The\n      Chinese Government takes stronger and harsher measures to control the progression of its\n      outbreak. Meanwhile, five editions of \"Diagnosis and Treatment for Novel Coronavirus-Infected\n      Pneumonia\" has been timely and continuously issued, which play extremely important roles in\n      guiding the clinical management of COVID-19 nationwide in China.\n\n      The symptoms of human infection with SARS-CoV-2 are generally fever, fatigue, dry cough and\n      dyspnea. Noteworthy, a considerable percentage of COVID-19 cases have rapidly progressed to\n      severe and critical type, among which acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress\n      syndrome (ARDS) are the most common complications, resulting in a large number of pneumonia\n      hospitalized patients requiring supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or even\n      ECMO.Pulmonary edema is a detrimental feature as well as a key causal factor of ALI/ARDS.\n\n      Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is considered as the most potent vascular\n      permeability inducers. Recent evidence has revealed higher VEGF levels in COVID-19 patients\n      compared with healthy controls. The rise of VEGF levels may be caused by hypoxia, severe\n      inflammation, and upregulation of the infected respiratory tract epithelium itself. Numerous\n      studies have confirmed a key role of VEGF as potential therapeutic target in acute lung\n      injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due do increase vascular\n      permeability and induce pulmonary edema.\n\n      Thus, Bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF medication, may offer a unique approach to treat ALI/ARDS\n      caused by COVID-19. Bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody with long half-life. It\n      has been approved by the FDA on February 26, 2004 and widely used in clinical oncotherapy,\n      with the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics having been widely understood. Therefore,\n      Bevacizumab is a promising drug for the treatment of ALI/ARDS as well as reduction of\n      mortality in severe and critical COVID-19 patients through suppression of pulmonary edema."
