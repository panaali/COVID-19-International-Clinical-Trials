            "textblock": "2019-new Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection (COVID-19) is highly contagious and responsible\n      for thousands of casualties. Originated in Wuhan (China), the 2019-nCoV is spreading to many\n      countries, including Italy, Korea and Japan. While no targeted-treatment against 2019-nCoV\n      virus is available to-date, inhaled nitric oxide gas (NO) has shown antiviral activity\n      against Coronavirus during the 2003 SARS outbreak. The investigators designed this study to\n      assess whether inhaled NO improves survival in patients affected with severe COVID-2019.\n\n      The clinical spectrum of symptomatic patients ranges from mild upper respiratory syndrome to\n      severe diffuse viral pneumonia in the context of severe multiorgan dysfunction leading to\n      death. In China, overall reported fatality rate is between 2.2% in patients with proven\n      infection. In hospitalized patients with COVID-19, about 25% required admission to ICU. Of\n      these, 61% of patients met clinical criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\n      In another retrospective study in Wuhan (China) on 52 critically ill patients with COVID-19,\n      the incidence of patients with pneumonia meeting ARDS criteria was 67%. ICU mortality reached\n      63%, with various profiles of combined organ failure in deceased patients (81% with ARDS,\n      37.5% with AKI, 28% with cardiac injury and 28% with liver failure).\n\n      In 2004, during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak, it was\n      demonstrated that treatment with NO reversed pulmonary hypertension, improved severe hypoxia\n      and shortened the length of ventilatory support as compared to matched control patients with\n      SARS-CoV. In a subsequent in-vitro study, NO donors (e.g. S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine)\n      greatly increased the survival rate of SARS-CoV-infected eukaryotic cells, suggesting direct\n      antiviral effects of NO. Coronavirus responsible for SARS-CoV shares most of the genome of\n      COVID-19 indicating potential effectiveness of inhaled NO therapy in these patients.\n\n      Here, the investigators propose a randomized clinical trial aimed to prevent progression of\n      the disease in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome.\n\n      Control group: the institutional standard of care will be delivered. Treatment group: in\n      addition to standard therapy, the subjects will receive inhalation of NO. Inspired NO/N2 will\n      be delivered at 80 parts per million (ppm) in the first 48 hours of enrollment. After that,\n      NO levels will be decreased to 40 ppm until severe hypoxia resolves. Weaning from NO will\n      start when patients improves the level of oxygenation to a PaO2/FiO2 > 300 mmHg or SpO2 > 93%\n      for more than 24 hours consecutively. Physician will follow their own institutional weaning\n      protocols. In the absence of institutional protocols, NO will be reduced every 4 hours in\n      step-wise fashion starting from 40 ppm to 20, 10, 5, 3, 2 and 1 ppm. If hypoxemia (SpO2 <\n      93%) or acute hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg) occurs during weaning, NO\n      should be increased to a prior higher concentration.\n\n      Safety: prolonged treatment with inhaled NO can lead to increased methemoglobin levels. Blood\n      levels of methemoglobin will be monitored via a non-invasive CO-oximeter or MetHb levels in\n      blood. If methemoglobin levels rise above 5% at any point of the study, inhaled NO\n      concentration will be halved."
