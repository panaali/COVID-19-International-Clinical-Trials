Preventing progression from early acute hypoxia and\n      cytokine release syndrome to frank hypoxic respiratory failure and ARDS could have a huge\n      impact on the foreseeable overflow of the ICU units. In ventilated patients, preventing the\n      onset of ARDS, or shortening ICU stay could also be crucial in this regard.\n\n      The clinical status after 15 days treatment is evaluated to measure the effectiveness of\n      tocilizumab, tocilizumab and anakinra, siltuximab, siltuximab and anakinra and anakinra on\n      restoring lung homeostasis,using single IV injection (siltuximab or tocilizumab) combined or\n      not with daily subcutaneous injections of anakinra until 28 days or hospital discharge,\n      whichever is first. During the treatment period, daily clinical assesments of severity, daily\n      laboratory check-up, measurements of oxygen saturation (pulse oximetry) in relation to FiO2,\n      regular arterial blood gas measurements, regular chest X-rays, chest CT scans on indication\n      will be performed."

In those cases, in absence of an alternative\n             diagnosis, and with highly suspect bilateral ground glass opacities on recent (<24h)\n             chest-CT scan (confirmed by a radiologist and pulmonary physician as probable\n             COVID-19), and a typical clinical and chemical diagnosis with signs of cytokine\n             release syndrome, a patient can be enrolled as probable COVID-19 infected. In all\n             cases, this needs confirmation by later seroconversion.\n\n          -  Presence of hypoxia defined as PaO2/FiO2 below 350 while breathing room air in upright\n             position or PaO2/FiO2 below 280 on supplemental oxygen and immediately requiring high\n             flow oxygen device or mechanical ventilation\n\n          -  signs of cytokine release syndrome defined as ANY of the following:\n\n               1. serum ferritin concentration >1000 mcg/L and rising since last 24h\n\n               2. single ferritin above 2000 mcg/L in patients requiring immediate high flow oxygen\n                  device or mechanical ventilation\n\n               3. lymphopenia defined as <800 lymphocytes/microliter) and two of the following\n                  extra criteria\n\n                    -  Ferritin > 700 mcg/L and rising since last 24h\n\n                    -  increased LDH (above 300 IU/L) and rising last 24h\n\n                    -  D-Dimers > 1000 ng/mL and rising since last 24h\n\n                    -  CRP above 70mg/L and rising since last 24h and absence of bacterial\n                       infection\n\n                    -  if three of the above are present at admission, no need to document 24h rise\n\n          -  Chest X-ray or CT scan showing bilateral infiltrates within last 2 days\n\n          -  Admitted to specialized COVID-19 ward or an ICU ward taking care of COVID-19 patients\n\n          -  Age \u2265 18yrs\n\n          -  Male or Female\n\n          -  Willing and able to provide informed consent or legal representative willing to\n             provide informed consent\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Patients with known history of serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, to\n             any of the study medications, or any component of the product.\n\n          -  mechanical ventilation > 24 h at randomization\n\n          -  clinical frailty scale above 3\n\n          -  active bacterial or fungal infection\n\n          -  unlikely to survive beyond 48h\n\n          -  neutrophil count below 1500 cells/microliter\n\n          -  platelets below 50.000/microliter\n\n          -  Patients enrolled in another investigational drug study\n\n          -  patients on high dose systemic steroids (> 20 mg methylprednisolone or equivalent) for\n             COVID-19 unrelated disorder\n\n          -  patients on immunosuppressant or immunomodulatory drugs\n\n          -  patients on current anti-IL1 or anti-IL6 treatment\n\n          -  signs of active tuberculosis\n\n          -  serum transaminase levels >5 times upper limit of normal\n\n          -  bowel perforation or diverticulitis\n\n          -  pregnant or breastfeeding females (all female subjects deemed of childbearing\n             potential by the investigator must have negative pregnancy test at screening)"
