The overall goal of the Registry is to create and\n      engage a community of HCWs who may be eligible for participation in future research studies,\n      including those of COVID-19 prophylaxis and treatment. The Hero registry will create a\n      repository of health care workers that can be eligible for future research studies. The main\n      objectives of the study are, 1) create a virtual community of adult HCWs in the United\n      States, 2) Identify HCWs interested in engaging in upcoming research studies, including those\n      related to COVID-19, and 3) Create a dataset of health related measurements, risk factors,\n      and outcomes for future analysis. The population of interest is adult healthcare workers in\n      the United States.\n\n      All analysis of the HERO Registry will be exploratory in nature. Analysis may include\n      descriptive statistics of the cohort, statistical associations between variables of interest,\n      and predictive modeling for health outcomes and behaviors. Analyses may be conducted on all\n      participants in the HERO Registry or may be conducted on subpopulations defined based on\n      clinical, demographic or other factors.\n\n      There is no direct benefit to the participants for their participation in this study, but the\n      information obtained will be used in scientific research and may be helpful to the\n      participant or others in the future. Participants may experience indirect benefits such as\n      learning about their own health, access to health data, and opportunities to participate in\n      future research."
