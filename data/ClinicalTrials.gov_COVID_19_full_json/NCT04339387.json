Use multivariable logistic regression with forward selection\n                informed by clinical judgement to choose variables a priori that emphasizes readily\n                available data and easy calculation for use at the point of care.\n\n             -  Use 25% of this cohort to retrospectively validate the risk-score.\n\n        2. Prospective Validation.\n\n             -  Select all adult patients with a positive reverse transcription polymerase chain\n                reaction for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 as soon as the\n                derivation cohort in step 1 is assembled. Include approximately 250 patients.\n\n             -  Use this sample to prospectively validate the risk-score developed in part 1."
