Human convalescent plasma is an option for treatment of COVID-19 and could be\n      rapidly available when there are sufficient numbers of people who have recovered and can\n      donate high titer neutralizing immunoglobulin-containing plasma.\n\n      Hypothesis: Collecting and administering convalescent plasma requires a level of logistical\n      coordination that is not available in all centers.\n\n      Objective: To establish feasibility for a hospital-based integrated system to collect and\n      administer convalescent plasma to patients with severe or life-threatening COVID-19."
