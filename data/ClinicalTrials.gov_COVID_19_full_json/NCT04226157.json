The investigators hypothesize that hypertensive stroke survivors in\n      the Washington, DC area who participate in the Home Blood Pressure Monitoring program will\n      have a greater reduction in mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) from baseline to 3 months, as\n      measured by automated office blood pressure (AOBP), as compared to usual care."}, "detailed_description": {"textblock": "The purpose of this trial is to determine if a home blood pressure self-management (HBPS)\n      program, including home monitoring and medication adjustments, is practical to use in recent\n      stroke survivors and whether or not it is associated with lowering blood pressure after 3\n      months. Data from this trial may be used to do more research and may be used by doctors when\n      seeing patients.This research is being done because high blood pressure, also called\n      hypertension, is the leading risk factor for stroke. Lowering blood pressure (BP) has been\n      shown to lower the risk of future strokes. The majority of stroke survivors continue to have\n      uncontrolled BP. Currently, blood pressure (BP) is most often measured in the doctor's\n      office. However, those single BP measurements are not the best picture of blood pressure over\n      time and can be influenced by the stress of being in a doctor's office, known as the \"white\n      coat effect\". This is why measuring BP at home may paint a more accurate picture of a\n      patient's true long-term BP. Home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) is recommended in the\n      recently updated national hypertension guidelines. Home BP monitoring plus guided BP\n      medication self-adjustments is associated with lower BP in patients with high blood pressure.\n      The investigators believe that a HBPS program, including medication self-adjustment and home\n      monitoring, may help to reduce blood pressure in patients with hypertension within 3 months."}, "overall_status": "Recruiting", "start_date": {"@type": "Actual", "#text": "February 21, 2019"}, "completion_date": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "March 31, 2021"}, "primary_completion_date": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "December 31, 2020"}, "phase": "N/A", "study_type": "Interventional", "has_expanded_access": "No", "study_design_info": {"allocation": "Randomized", "intervention_model": "Parallel Assignment", "intervention_model_description": "Patients with hypertension who have had a stroke within the past 6 months will be randomized into two groups in a one to one ratio: Home Blood Pressure Self-Management (HBPS) or Usual Care.", "primary_purpose": "Prevention", "masking": "None (Open Label)"}, "primary_outcome": {"measure": "Feasibility of blood pressure self management in stroke survivors", "time_frame": "Three Months", "description": "At least 75 percent of HBPS participants will successfully complete the monitoring and self-titration intervention."}, "secondary_outcome": {"measure": "Systolic Blood Pressure Difference", "time_frame": "three months", "description": "Difference in systolic blood pressure from baseline to three months between HBPS and Usual Care arms."}, "number_of_arms": "2", "enrollment": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "32"}, "condition": ["Ischemic Stroke", "Hypertension"], "arm_group": [{"arm_group_label": "Home Blood Pressure Self Management", "arm_group_type": "Experimental", "description": "The HBPS group will check their blood pressure at home daily using a smart BP cuff with telemonitoring capability (Home Qardio) and guided to use a self-titration plan between office visits for persistently elevate blood pressures."}, {"arm_group_label": "Usual Care", "arm_group_type": "Active Comparator", "description": "The Usual Care group will have their blood pressure monitored and medications adjusted by their primary care provider."}], "intervention": [{"intervention_type": "Device", "intervention_name": "Home Blood Pressure Monitoring Device (Qardio Arm)", "description": "The Home Blood Pressure Device with telemonitoring capability will allow the participants and physician to monitor blood pressure over time and titrate blood pressure medications as needed for persistently elevated blood pressure.", "arm_group_label": "Home Blood Pressure Self Management", "other_name": "Medication Self-Titration"}, {"intervention_type": "Other", "intervention_name": "Primary Care Provider Blood Pressure Management", "description": "Participant will follow up as would normally do with primary care provider for blood pressure management.", "arm_group_label": "Usual Care"}], "eligibility": {"criteria": {"textblock": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Acute ischemic stroke in the past 180 days of screening\n\n          -  Age >/= 18 years old\n\n          -  Automated Office Blood Pressure \u2265135 systolic or \u226585 diastolic at time of screening\n\n          -  Stage 2 hypertension (as defined by >140 mmHg SBP and or >90 mmHg DBP on 2 occasions\n             or history of hypertension prior to stroke or currently taking antihypertensive\n             medications)\n\n          -  Able to live independently (as defined by modified Rankin scale score of 0-2)\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  CKD stage IV or greater (GFR < 30)\n\n          -  Inability to check BP in either arm (e.g. amputation, lymphedema)\n\n          -  Pregnancy\n\n          -  High-grade intracranial or extracranial stenosis requiring a higher BP goal\n\n          -  Unable to provide informed consent for themselves in English or Spanish\n\n          -  Life expectancy less than 12 months"}, "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No"}, "overall_contact": {"last_name": "Mary Carter Denny, MD", "phone": "202-444-8532", "email": "MaryCarter.Denny@medstar.net"}, "location": {"facility": {"name": "Medstar Georgetown University Hospital", "address": {"city": "Washington", "state": "District of Columbia", "zip": "20007", "country": "United States"}}, "status": "Recruiting", "contact": {"last_name": "Mary Carter Denny", "phone": "202-444-8532", "email": "MaryCarter.Denny@medstar.net"}}, "location_countries": {"country": "United States"}, "reference": [{"citation": "Ovbiagele B, Nguyen-Huynh MN.
