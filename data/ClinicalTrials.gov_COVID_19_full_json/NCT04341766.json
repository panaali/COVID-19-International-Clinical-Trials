The rapid diagnosis of respiratory disorders\n      in infected patients is important for further management.\n\n      Chest ultrasound has already demonstrated its value in the diagnosis of pneumonia in the\n      emergency department with superiority over chest X-ray.\n\n      However, there is little data on the thoracic ultrasound semiology of viral pneumonia in\n      general and of COVID in particular."

The abnormalities are a\n      thickening of the pleuropneumonia line, an interstitial syndrome with B lines, corresponding\n      to frosted glass opacities, confluent B lines (snowstorm appearance) corresponding to\n      interstitial infiltrate, sub-pleural alveolar opacities corresponding to sub-pleural\n      condensations, more frank alveolar images corresponding to alveolar opacities. A multifocal\n      aspect was associated with involvement of more than 2 lobes. However, the frequency of these\n      abnormalities as well as the sensitivity of the echo are not detailed in this article.\n\n      Another Italian article describes a clinical case of COVID-19 pneumonia with sub-pleural\n      involvement and irregularity of the pleuro-pulmonary line.\n\n      Clinical thoracic ultrasound has a major potential interest during the COVID epidemic:\n      available at the patient's bedside, avoiding the need to move around, feasible for the\n      physician during his visit, easy to clean especially if ultraportable devices are used, fast\n      and not exposing the staff any more than the usual clinical examination.\n\n      In order to determine whether this technique is useful in the management of infected patients\n      or patients suspected of COVID-19 infection with respiratory signs, we propose a descriptive\n      prospective study evaluating the ultrasound semiology of COVID-19 pneumonia and the interest\n      of ultrasound in the evolutionary follow-up of these patients."
