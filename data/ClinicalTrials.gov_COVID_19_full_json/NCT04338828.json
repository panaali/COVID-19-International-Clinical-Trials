While COVID-19 patients have\n      an increased need for supportive care, there is currently no specific treatment directed\n      against 2019-nCoV. Nitric oxide inhalation has been used as a pulmonary vasodilator and has\n      been found to have antiviral activity against other coronavirus strains. The primary aim of\n      this study is to determine whether inhaled NO improves short term respiratory status,\n      prevents future hospitalization, and improves the clinical course in patients diagnosed with\n      COVID-19 specifically in the emergency department."

While COVID-19 patients have\n      an increased need for supportive care, there is currently no specific treatment directed\n      against 2019-nCoV. Nitric oxide inhalation has been used as a pulmonary vasodilator and has\n      been found to have antiviral activity against other coronavirus strains.\n\n      Preliminary data support a microbicidal effect of high concentration inhaled NO. We\n      hypothesize that high concentration inhaled NO can have a viricidal effect against SARS-Cov-2\n      and prevent the deterioration to a severe form of COVID-19 when administered at an early\n      stage of the disease. Additional potential mechanisms why INO may be effective in this\n      indication: 1)improves V/Q ratio, 2) reduces PVR and PAP, 3) Anti-thrombotic in lung. This\n      would have potential benefit for the patients in terms of reducing the severity of the\n      clinical course and time to recovery. An additional benefit could be for the society since a\n      faster and a less severe clinical course could protect limited hospital resources (ED, floor,\n      and ICU) from being overwhelmed.\n\n      The primary aim is to prevent the deterioration of mild COVID-19 infection (defined by a\n      RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 in a specimen from any site) with respiratory signs/ symptoms\n      to a more severe form of the disease as defined by the patient needing to 1) return to the\n      ED, 2) be admitting to the hospital, 3) be intubated, 4) and all cause 28 day mortality."
