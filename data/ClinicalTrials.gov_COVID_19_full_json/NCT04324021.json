The objective of this study is\n      to investigate new possibilities to reduce the number of patients requiring mechanical\n      ventilation. This is intended to address the most urgent need to preserve the access to\n      intensive care unit support to the lowest possible number of patients and may potentially\n      reduce mortality."

Patients\n      between 30 and 80 years will be eligible to participate in the study. The study is planned to\n      consist of three groups, each comprising 18 patients. Treatment will be randomized to either\n      Emapalumab+SoC, Anakinra+SoC or only SoC for two weeks. Follow-up visit or phone calls will\n      be made 4 and 8 weeks after end of treatment period."
