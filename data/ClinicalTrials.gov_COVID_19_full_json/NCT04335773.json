Also, the study focuses solely on\n      children.\n\n      Children (0-18 years of age) admitted to hospital with suspected COVID-19 are eligible (Fig.\n      1). Those with confirmed COVID-19 serve as cases, whereas those with non-COVID-19 serve as\n      controls; both groups will be followed prospectively for 6 months. Three objectives/Work\n      Packages (WPs) are defined:\n\n        -  In WP1, we will investigate risk factors for severe outcome of the acute infection;\n           potential risk factors include sex, age, comorbidities, initial clinical findings,\n           infectious load, and genetic markers.\n\n        -  In WP2, we will investigate the immunological response to acute infection, focusing on\n           initial innate host response and its associations to inflammatory enhancement, genetic\n           factors and clinical course.\n\n        -  In WP3, we will investigate the prevalence and risk factors of long-lasting\n           complication, in particular the development of post-infectious chronic fatigue"
