            "textblock": "RuxCoFlam is a single arm, non-randomized open phase II trial for front line treatment of\n      Covid-19 patients with defined hyperinflammation. Purpose of the study is the reversal of\n      hyperinflammation to improve pulmonary function, reduce respiratory dependency and reduce\n      mortality. Patients with a hyperinflammation Score 10/16 without a clinical diagnosis of\n      sepsis will be treated with 2 x 10mg Ruxolitinib with defined response adapted dose\n      escalation up to 2 x 20mg for a duration of 7 days with clinical and/or radiographic response\n      assessment. Inflammation assessment will be performed every other day (day 3, 5,7) using the\n      CIS. In patients with unaffected CIS alteration < 25% or increasing CIS > 25% dose escalation\n      by 5mg steps (15mg, day3; 20mg day 5) at the investigator\u00b4s discretion. Treatment can be\n      extended up to 28 days if clinically indicated and the benefits of treatment outweigh the\n      risks. Primary endpoint of the study is the overall response rate in reversal of\n      hyperinflammation at day 7 compared to baseline. Secondary endpoints are total use of\n      assisted oxygenation dependency (duration (days) of invasive/non-invasive ventilation or\n      duration (days) of high-flow Oxygen support), radiologic response (reversal of pulmonary\n      Covid-signs, Lung-XRay/CT), day 15 clinical status and day 15 and day 29 mortality. Patients\n      aged \u226518 years hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia (demonstrated by CXRAY or chest CT), with\n      a study specific Covid Inflammation Score \u2265 10 are eligible. Patients with active\n      tuberculosis or uncontrolled bacterial, fungal, viral, or other infection (besides SARS-CoV-2\n      virus) will be excluded from the study."
