Although the pathological\n      mechanism of the pneumonia is unclear, some patients developed severe or critical condition\n      due to the continuous development of inflammation.\n\n      Inflammation is the early stage of fibrosis. After the control of acute symptoms and signs,\n      severe patients often have more manifestations of pulmonary fibrosis, which affects the\n      recurrence of lung function. Fuzheng Huayu tablets has been proved effective in inhibiting\n      MMP activity to protect subepithelial basement membrane which plays a key role in lung injury\n      and interstitial fibrosis.\n\n      This is a randomized, double blind, multicenter clinical study of pulmonary fibrosis due to\n      2019-nCoV. The main objective is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Fuzheng Huayu in\n      pulmonary fibrosis after 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n      In this study, 136 eligible patients with pulmonary fibrosis due to 2019-nCoV infection will\n      be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups at a 1:1 ratio.
