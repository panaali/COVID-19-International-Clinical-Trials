Unless otherwise specified, the secondary efficiency\n           indicators shall be included as observed data in the statistical analysis, and the\n           missing data shall not be filled in.\n\n           2.2.2The safety data shall not be filled in. 2.3Statistical method 2.3.1General\n           principle\n\n           Description of statistics:\n\n           The primary indicators collected in this study are described with statistical method.\n           Quantitative indicators are described by means of mean, standard deviation, median,\n           quartile, maximum, minimum and the like; qualitative indicators are described by\n           frequency, percentage and the like.\n\n           Statistical test:\n\n           Unless otherwise specified, the statistical significance level is 0.05 by two-sided test\n           (one-sided 0.025) and the 95% confidence interval shall be provided for the estimation\n           of inter-group variance parameters.\n\n           2.3.2Characteristics of cases Subject distribution The population and the number of\n           enrolled and completed cases in each center are listed, and three analysis data sets\n           (FAS, PPS, SS) are determined.\n\n           A detailed list of the data set categories is made. The number and ratio of subjects who\n           are randomly enrolled, complete the trial, and withdraw from the trial early and the\n           reasons are calculated.\n\n           The subject distribution flow chart is plotted. General information and baseline\n           characteristics The demographic information, previous medication history and history of\n           other diseases of the patients are described with statistical method. General\n           information and baseline characteristics are described based on FAS.\n\n           2.3.3Analysis of drug exposure and drug combination Analysis based on SS. The drug\n           exposure, dose intensity and exposure time of each group are calculated and subject to\n           descriptive statistical analysis.\n\n           The drug combination is coded by WHO ATC and summarized according to the ATC secondary\n           classification and PT. The number and ratio of cases are calculated.\n\n           2.3.4Efficiency analysis Analysis based on FAS and PPS.\n\n           Primary efficiency indicators:\n\n           The primary effective indicators are complete antipyresis time, pulmonary imaging\n           improvement indicators, and negative conversion ratio of pathogen nucleic acid testing\n           in throat swabs, urine and stool on Days 7-14 after administration.The non-inferiority\n           evaluation is based on FAS. The statistical significance level is set to one-sided 0.025\n           and the non-inferiority critical value is set to -10%. The negative conversion ratio of\n           pathogen nucleic acid testing in throat swabs, urine and stool on Days 7-14 after\n           administration in the trial group and positive control group is calculated respectively.\n           The negative conversion ratio difference (trial group - control group) between the trial\n           group and positive control group as well as the two-sided 95% confidence interval\n           (95%CI) are calculated. The confidence interval is estimated by Miettinen-Nurminen. If\n           the lower limit of 95% confidence interval for the negative conversion ratio difference\n           between the trial group and control group is greater than -10%, it is considered that\n           the trial drug for the indication is not inferior to the positive control drug. Given\n           that the non-inferiority hypothesis is true, if it is further obtained that the lower\n           limit of 95% confidence interval for the negative conversion ratio difference between\n           the trial group and control group is greater than 0, it is considered that the trial\n           drug for the indication is superior to the positive control drug. The inter-group ratio\n           difference and confidence interval estimation results after the site effect control will\n           be provided simultaneously as the sensitivity analysis and the sites with few subjects\n           may be combined before analysis.\n\n           Secondary efficiency indicators:\n\n           The secondary efficiency indicators include negative conversion ratio of pathogen\n           nucleic acid testing on Day 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 14 after administration, negative\n           conversion time, immune-related indicators (lymphocyte count, lymphocyte percentage,\n           counts and percentages of CD4 and CD8), SOFA score, white blood cell count and\n           C-reactive protein. The secondary efficiency indicators are subject to descriptive\n           statistical analysis according to the data type. Where, for the quantitative data, the\n           observed values in each visit and the changes in the observed values from baseline after\n           treatment are analyzed descriptively and provided with the inter-group difference\n           estimate value (trial group - control group) of the changes in indicators in different\n           visits from baseline and its 95% confidence interval; for the qualitative data, the\n           indicators in different visits are described in the form of a frequency table (frequency\n           and percentage) and provided with the inter-group ratio difference and confidence\n           interval estimate; for the survival data, such as the negative conversion time of\n           pathogen nucleic acid testing and complete antipyresis time, the median complete\n           antipyresis time and its 95% confidence interval in each group are calculated by\n           Kaplan-Meier, the information on the subject deletions at the end of the study is\n           provided and the survivorship curve is provided. The hazard ratio HR and its 90%\n           confidence interval of the trail group and the control group are estimated by Cox\n           proportional hazards regression.\n\n           2.3.5Safety analysis SS data sets are used for safety analysis. Adverse events are coded\n           according to the MedDRA.
