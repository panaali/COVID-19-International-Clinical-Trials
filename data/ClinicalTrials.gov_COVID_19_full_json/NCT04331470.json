This\n      disease is not only a health problem but also economy, culture and the whole entity of the\n      countries is under attack by the virus. This disease seems to affect the body in two\n      different pathology pathways. From one side virus can decrease activity of immune system in\n      the blood stream and whole body and from other side it can attack the respiratory cells.\n      Tissue biopsy shows that immune cells penetrate into the Lung tissue and we have accumulation\n      and over activity of Immune cells in the lung. This inflammation in respiratory tract\n      probably is the major cause of Cytokine storm and release of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 into the blood.\n\n      It seems that by three strategy disease can be treated. 1- By using systemic immune\n      simulators. 2- By using topical anti-inflammatory drug in the respiratory system (Steroids or\n      NSAIDs) 3- By inhibition of replication of the virus in the attacked cells."
        },
        "detailed_description": {
            "textblock": "Looking at the pathology of this disease shows that COVID-19 virus binds to the Angiotensin\n      converting enzyme II (ACE II) which is located on the surface of different cells in the body\n      and specially on the cells of respiratory system. This enzyme is responsible to turn\n      angiotensin II into angiotensin1-7. It is also turns angiotensin I into angiotensin 1-9.\n\n      When ACEII would be blocked by virus level of angiotensin II will be increased and this\n      enzyme along with vasoconstriction, makes cells to manufacture TNF \u03b1 and IL-6 which are\n      responsible for cytokine storm and Lymphopenia. Also presence of virus and virus shell on the\n      surface of the infected cells make immune system to attack to the respiratory system hence\n      effect of angiotensin II inside the cell causes fibrosis of the respiratory cells. This\n      inflammation and tissue damage make Acute Respiratory Distress syndrome (ARDS) which is\n      lethal for patients. There is a dilemma in treatment of this infection. From one side it\n      doesn't make sense to decrease the immune response hence it will make the infection worse.\n      And from other side stimulation of the immune response because of respiratory inflammation\n      can expedite process of lethal ARDS. A new strategy for treatment of this disease which\n      consists of local anti- inflammatory and systemic immune stimulant drugs can be considered as\n      a reasonable strategy.As immunostimulator, Levamisole can increase Lymphocytes and empower\n      the immunity of the body. This drug can also bind to Papaine Like Protease(PL-pro) of the\n      shell of the virus which is necessary for virulence of COVID-19. It also can decrease level\n      of TNF \u03b1 and IL-6, and as a chemical adjutant can introduce the virus to the immune system.\n      In addition to Levamisole, Formoterol+Budesonide inhaler can be used in this protocol.\n      Budesonide is a steroid and can suppress the immune reaction locally in the respiratory\n      system. Formoterol is \u03b22 agonist and can open airways. It also can bind to PL-pro and can\n      neutralize the virus according to the published articles."
