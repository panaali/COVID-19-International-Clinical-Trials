New infectious agents,\n      such as the SARS, MERS and other novel coronavirus, novel influenza viruses, viruses causing\n      viral haemorrhagic fever (e.g. Ebola), and viruses that affect the central nervous system\n      (CNS) such as TBEV & Nipah require investigation to understand pathogen biology and\n      pathogenesis in the host. Even for known infections, resistance to antimicrobial therapies is\n      widespread, and treatments to control potentially deleterious host responses are lacking.\n\n      In order to develop a mechanistic understanding of disease processes, such that risk factors\n      for severe illness can be identified and treatments can be developed, it is necessary to\n      understand pathogen characteristics associated with virulence, the replication dynamics and\n      in-host evolution of the pathogen, the dynamics of the host response, the pharmacology of\n      antimicrobial or host-directed therapies, the transmission dynamics, and factors underlying\n      individual susceptibility.\n\n      The work proposed here may require sampling that will not immediately benefit the\n      participants. It may also require analysis of the host genome, which may reveal other\n      information about disease susceptibility or other aspects of health status."
