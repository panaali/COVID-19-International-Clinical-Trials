            "textblock": "Infection with the SARS-Cov-2 virus, responsible of severe acute respiratory distress\n      syndrome (SARS), is an emerging infectious disease called Covid-19 and declared as pandemic\n      by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. This pandemic is responsible of\n      significant mortality. In France, several thousand patients are hospitalized in intensive\n      care units, and their number continues to increase. Mortality during Covid-19 is mainly\n      linked to acute respiratory distress syndrome, which frequency is estimated in France to\n      occur in 6% of infected patients. Comorbidities such as cardiovascular conditions, obesity\n      and diabetes increase susceptibility to severe forms of Covid-19 and associated mortality.\n      Therapeutic management has three components: symptomatic management, including supplementary\n      oxygen therapy and in case of respiratory distress mechanical ventilation; the antiviral\n      approach; and immunomodulation, aiming at reducing inflammation associated with viral\n      infection, which is considered to take part in severe presentations of the disease.\n\n      During Covid-19 viral pneumonia related to SARS-COv-2, there is a significant release of\n      pro-inflammatory cytokines in the acute phase of viral infection, which could participate in\n      viral pneumonia lesions. In children with less mature immune system than adults, SARS-Cov-2\n      infection is less severe. The current prevailing assumption is that severe forms of Covid-19\n      may not only be related to high viral replication, but also to an excessive inflammatory\n      response favoring acute lung injury and stimulating infection.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that early control of the excessive inflammatory response may\n      help reducing the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n      The investigators will evaluate the benefit, safety and tolerability of corticosteroid\n      therapy to reduce the rate of subjects hospitalized for Covid-19 viral pneumonia who\n      experience clinical worsening with a need of high-flow supplemental oxygen supplementation or\n      transfer in intensive care units for respiratory support."
