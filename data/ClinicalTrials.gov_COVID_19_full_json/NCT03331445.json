In addition COVID-19 has know current\n      treatment. These patients have few options to treat their lung infection. Nitric oxide has\n      broad bactericidal and virucidal properties. It has been shown that nitric oxide was safe to\n      be inhaled for similar cystic fibrosis patients and reduced drug resistant bacteria in the\n      lungs. Further, research indicates that clinical isolates of NTM, Burkholderia spp,\n      Aspergillus spp and Corona-like viruses can be eradicated by 160ppm NO exposure in the\n      laboratory petri dish. This is not the first time inhaled NO treatment has been used in\n      patients with difficult lung infections.
