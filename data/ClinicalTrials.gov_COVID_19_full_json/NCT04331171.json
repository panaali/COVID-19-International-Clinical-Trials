As of 3/16/2020,\n      the epidemic affects more than 100 countries with 169,000 official infections and 6,500\n      deaths. This virus causes a pathology ranging from simple flu symptoms in 80% of cases to\n      acute respiratory distress syndromes requiring resuscitation in 5% of cases and a death rate\n      of 1.4 to 4% of cases (Guan NEJM 2020, Wang JAMA 2020).\n\n      The arrival in France on 02/25/2020 with an exponential development of the infection (more\n      than 5,000 cases on 03/15/2020) was accompanied by an unprecedented number of calls to the\n      French emergency service call number (15) of worried patients with overload and sometimes\n      saturation of the service that can impact calls and the care of patients really recovering\n      from an emergency.\n\n      We previously developed a Moovcare\u00ae web application which showed a 7 months survival benefit\n      by early detection of relapsed lung cancer based on the reporting of patient symptoms\n      analyzed by a validated algorithm in 300 patients and 1 trial randomized (Denis F JAMA 2019).\n      Another application for detecting and monitoring chemo-induced febrile aplasia appears to\n      show a reduction in the number of hospitalizations for sepsis (Denis F et al, Supp Care\n      Cancer 2019). Finally, Smokecheck, a self-assessment application for symptoms by smokers, has\n      shown that it improves the detection of symptomatic operable bronchial cancers (9 to 24%, p =\n      0.04, J of Thoracic Oncol 2020 submitted).\n\n      The web application https://www.maladiecoronavirus.fr/ was developed with a group of\n      physicians from the Institut Pasteur, Hospitals group of Paris, Hospitals of Lille and Rennes\n      and the ILC Jean Bernard in Le Mans. It makes it possible to guide symptomatic patients and\n      patients who wishing to know what to do (call their general practitioner, teleconsultation,\n      or call emergency service) based on symptoms and predictive factors of severity.\n\n      Following the availability of this new tool, we want to assess the impact of the application\n      on the number and relevance of calls to emergency service."}, "overall_status": "Recruiting", "start_date": {"@type": "Actual", "#text": "March 17, 2020"}, "completion_date": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "July 31, 2020"}, "primary_completion_date": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "March 31, 2020"}, "study_type": "Observational [Patient Registry]", "has_expanded_access": "No", "study_design_info": {"observational_model": "Cohort", "time_perspective": "Prospective"}, "target_duration": "1 Day", "primary_outcome": [{"measure": "Evaluation of the evolution of the number of calls to Emergency service within 5 days after the launch of the application https://www.maladiecoronavirus.fr/", "time_frame": "5 days", "description": "Number of calls to Emergency service after the launch of web application comparded to the days before"}, {"measure": "Evaluation of the evolution of the proportion of relevant calls to Emergency service within 5 days after the launch of the application https://www.maladiecoronavirus.fr/", "time_frame": "5 days", "description": "Number of relevants calls to Emergency service after the launch of web application comparded to the days before"}], "secondary_outcome": [{"measure": "Monitoring the evolution over time and space of the COVID 19 epidemic", "time_frame": "3 months", "description": "the symptoms collected by the application"}, {"measure": "Descriptive analysis of symptoms", "time_frame": "3 months", "description": "Symptoms collected by web-application"}, {"measure": "Descriptive analysis of the user population, their symptoms and their comorbidities", "time_frame": "3 months", "description": "Demographic data, comorbidity and symptoms collected by web-application"}], "number_of_groups": "1", "enrollment": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "15000000"}, "condition": "COVID-19", "arm_group": {"arm_group_label": "Web-application users", "description": "questionnaire of comorbidity and symptomes completed by the user on his smartphone"}, "intervention": {"intervention_type": "Device", "intervention_name": "Web application users", "description": "questionnaire of comorbidity and symptoms completed by the patient on his smartphone", "arm_group_label": "Web-application users"}, "eligibility": {"study_pop": {"textblock": "All users of the https://www.maladiecoronavirus.fr/ application over the age of 18"}, "sampling_method": "Probability Sample", "criteria": {"textblock": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  All users of the https://www.maladiecoronavirus.fr/ application over the age of 18\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  not applicable"}, "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "Accepts Healthy Volunteers"}, "overall_official": {"last_name": "Fabrice DENIS, MD", "role": "Study Director", "affiliation": "Jean Bernard Center - LE MANS"}, "overall_contact": {"last_name": "Fabrice DENIS, MD", "phone": "241682940", "phone_ext": "0033", "email": "f.denis@cjb72.org"}, "location": {"facility": {"name": "All French Emergency services", "address": {"city": "Le Mans", "country": "France"}}, "status": "Recruiting", "contact": {"last_name": "Fabrice DENIS, MD"}, "investigator": {"last_name": "Fabrice DENIS, MD", "role": "Principal Investigator"}}, "location_countries": {"country": "France"}, "verification_date": "March 2020", "study_first_submitted": "March 30, 2020", "study_first_submitted_qc": "March 30, 2020", "study_first_posted": {"@type": "Estimate", "#text": "April 2, 2020"}, "last_update_submitted": "March 30, 2020", "last_update_submitted_qc": "March 30, 2020", "last_update_posted": {"@type": "Estimate", "#text": "April 2, 2020"}, "responsible_party": {"responsible_party_type": "Sponsor"}, "keyword": ["M-health", "COVID-19", "Self-assessment application", "epidemiology", "symptoms"], "patient_data": {"sharing_ipd": "No"}}}
