The disease caused by the new respiratory virus (coronavirus) designated as\n      SARS-CoV-2 has recently been classified as a pandemic by the WHO.\n\n      With an increasing number of confirmed cases in most countries worldwide, it is responsible\n      for a significant morbidity and mortality and has motivated the implementation of measures at\n      national and international levels with a great impact on the way of life of people throughout\n      the whole planet.\n\n      In addition, this condition currently threatens many countries with the collapse of health\n      systems, producing serious logistical problems due to extensive affectation of the\n      population, which can worsen the prognosis of those primarily affected by COVID 19 and other\n      patients with different pathologies and who may have difficulties to get healthcare.\n\n      Limited clinical information is available and generally limited to the Asian population,\n      since the first cases were identified in Wuhan (Hubei, China).\n\n      PURPOSE. The main objective of the present study is to carefully characterize the clinical\n      profile of patients infected with COVID-19 in order to develop a simple prognostic clinical\n      score allowing, in selected cases, rapid logistic decision making (discharge with follow-up,\n      referral to provisional/field hospitals or admission to more complex hospital centers).\n\n      As secondary objectives, the analysis of the risk-adjusted influence of treatments (ie.\n      ACEIs, ARBs) and previous comorbidities of patients infected with the disease will be\n      performed.\n\n      DESIGN AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Cross-sectional and ambispective registry, a real life \"all\n      comers\" type, with voluntary participation, without funding or conflicts of interest. It is a\n      study initiated by researcher that will have advanced statistical support from the IMAS\n      foundation (Institute for the Improvement of Health Care, Madrid, Spain), that will serve as\n      statistical core.\n\n      International level.\n\n      PARTICIPANTS PROTOCOL. The study has been approved by Hospital Clinico San Carlos Ethic\u00b4s\n      Committee (20/241-E) and the institutional board of each participating center. It has\n      received an AEMPS classification (EPA-0D).\n\n      The researchers aimto select all the patients attended in any health center (with in hospital\n      beds), who have been discharged or have died at the time of the evaluation.\n\n      All will be considered eligible with a positive COVID 19 test (any type) or if their\n      attending physicians consider them highly likely to have presented the infection.\n\n      Given the anonymous characteristics of the registry and the health alarm situation generated\n      by the virus, in principle, it is not considered necessary to provide written informed\n      consent.\n\n      - Inclusion criteria Patients discharged (deceased or alive) from any hospital center with a\n      confirmed diagnosis or a COVID-19 high suspicion.\n\n      There are no exclusion criteria, except for the patient's explicit refusal to participate.\n\n      DATA BASE. An anonymized database is presented in electronic format, to be filled in at each\n      participating center (www.HopeProjectMD.com).\n\n      In theory, all information could be obtained from electronic records (medical history).\n\n      If deemed necessary, the investigator may call patients in order to establish their vital\n      status (strongly warranted), as well as the results of the RNA test (or antibody) , if they\n      were pending during their stay.\n\n      SAMPLE SIZE. It would not be possible to estimate for the sample size based on literature\n      reports. Thus, HOPE will aim to get the maximum numbers of patients possible.\n\n      OUTCOMES. Primary: All-cause mortality. The major contributors of increased mortality will be\n      assessed.\n\n      Secondary: In stay events, defined by the attending physician.\n\n        -  In hospital stay.\n\n        -  Heart failure.\n\n        -  Renal failure.\n\n        -  Respiratory Insufficiency.\n\n        -  Upper respiratory tract involvement.\n\n        -  Pneumonia.\n\n        -  Sepsis.\n\n        -  Systemic inflammatory response Syndrome.\n\n        -  Clinically relevant bleeding.\n\n        -  Hemoptysis.\n\n        -  Embolic event\n\n        -  Other complications.\n\n        -  Causes of death. Depending the results of the main interim analysis, the main DB could\n           be slightly modified and several sub analyses could be proposed after sensitivity\n           analyses."}, "overall_status": "Recruiting", "start_date": {"@type": "Actual", "#text": "March 23, 2020"}, "completion_date": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "May 5, 2020"}, "primary_completion_date": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "May 1, 2020"}, "study_type": "Observational [Patient Registry]", "has_expanded_access": "No", "study_design_info": {"observational_model": "Cohort", "time_perspective": "Cross-Sectional"}, "target_duration": "2 Weeks", "primary_outcome": {"measure": "Death", "time_frame": "through study completion, an average of 1 month", "description": "All cause"}, "secondary_outcome": [{"measure": "In hospital stay.", "time_frame": "through study completion, an average of 1 month", "description": "Days"}, {"measure": "Heart failure", "time_frame": "through study completion, an average of 1 month", "description": "According the attending physician."}, {"measure": "Renal failure", "time_frame": "through study completion, an average of 1 month", "description": "According the attending physician."}, {"measure": "Respiratory Insufficiency.", "time_frame": "through study completion, an average of 1 month", "description": "According the attending physician."}, {"measure": "Upper respiratory tract involvement", "time_frame": "through study completion, an average of 1 month", "description": "According the attending physician."}, {"measure": "Pneumonia", "time_frame": "through study completion, an average of 1 month", "description": "According the attending physician."}, {"measure": "Sepsis", "time_frame": "through study completion, an average of 1 month", "description": "According the attending physician."}, {"measure": "Systemic inflammatory response Syndrome.", "time_frame": "through study completion, an average of 1 month", "description": "According the attending physician."}, {"measure": "Clinically relevant bleeding", "time_frame": "through study completion, an average of 1 month", "description": "According the attending physician."}, {"measure": "Other complications.", "time_frame": "through study completion, an average of 1 month", "description": "According the attending physician."}], "enrollment": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "2500"}, "condition": "COVID 19", "intervention": {"intervention_type": "Combination Product", "intervention_name": "Observational (registry)", "description": "Observational study."}, "eligibility": {"study_pop": {"textblock": "Confirmed diagnosis or a COVID-19 high suspicion."}, "sampling_method": "Non-Probability Sample", "criteria": {"textblock": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Patients discharged (deceased or alive) from any hospital center with a confirmed\n             diagnosis or a COVID-19 high suspicion.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  There are no exclusion criteria, except for the patient's explicit refusal to\n             participate."}, "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "N/A", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No"}, "overall_contact": {"last_name": "IVAN J NUNEZ GIL, MD, PhD, MSc", "phone": "0034 913303002", "phone_ext": "3283", "email": "ibnsky@yahoo.es"}, "location": {"facility": {"name": "Hospital Lclinico San Carlos", "address": {"city": "Madrid", "zip": "28040", "country": "Spain"}}, "status": "Recruiting", "contact": {"last_name": "IVAN J NU\u00d1EZ J NU\u00d1EZ GIL, MD", "phone": "913303002", "phone_ext": "3283", "email": "ibnsky@yahoo.es"}}, "location_countries": {"country": "Spain"}, "link": {"url": "https://hopeprojectmd.com/en/", "description": "HOPE WEB PAGE AND E-CRD"}, "verification_date": "April 2020", "study_first_submitted": "April 1, 2020", "study_first_submitted_qc": "April 3, 2020", "study_first_posted": {"@type": "Estimate", "#text": "April 6, 2020"}, "last_update_submitted": "April 3, 2020", "last_update_submitted_qc": "April 3, 2020", "last_update_posted": {"@type": "Estimate", "#text": "April 6, 2020"}, "responsible_party": {"responsible_party_type": "Sponsor-Investigator", "investigator_affiliation": "St Carlos Hospital, Madrid, Spain", "investigator_full_name": "IVAN J NU\u00d1EZ GIL", "investigator_title": "Principal Investigator.
