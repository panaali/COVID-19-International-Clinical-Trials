Subjects must have a documented positive test for the COVID-19 virus within 72\n             hours of the administration of study drug\n\n          -  2. Subjects who have no requirement for oxygen (Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement\n             score of 3 or less)\n\n          -  3. Subjects must be under observation or admitted to a controlled facility or hospital\n             (home quarantine is not sufficient)\n\n          -  4. Subjects must be receiving standard of care (SOC) for COVID-19\n\n          -  5. Subject's spirometry (forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV1] and forced\n             vital capacity [FVC]) must be \u226570% of predicted value\n\n          -  6. If female, must be either post-menopausal (one year or greater without menses),\n             surgically sterile, or, for female subjects of child-bearing potential who are capable\n             of conception must be: practicing two effective methods of birth control (acceptable\n             methods include intrauterine device, spermicide, barrier, male partner surgical\n             sterilization, and hormonal contraception) during the study and through 30 days after\n             completion of the study. Abstinence is not classified as an effective method of birth\n             control.\n\n          -  7. If female, must not be pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or nurse a child during\n             the study and through 30 days after completion of the study. A pregnancy test must be\n             negative at the Screening Visit, prior to dosing on Day 1.\n\n          -  8. If male, must be surgically sterile or willing to practice two effective methods of\n             birth control (acceptable methods include barrier, spermicide, or female partner\n             surgical sterilization) during the study and through 30 days after completion of the\n             study. Abstinence is not classified as an effective method of birth control.\n\n          -  9. Must have the ability to understand and give informed consent.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  1. No documented infection with SARS-CoV-2\n\n          -  2. Patients who are symptomatic and require oxygen (Ordinal Scale for Clinical\n             Improvement score >3) at the time of screening\n\n          -  3. Known history of chronic pulmonary disease (e.g., asthma [including atopic asthma,\n             exercise-induced asthma, or asthma triggered by respiratory infection], chronic\n             pulmonary disease, pulmonary fibrosis, COPD), pulmonary hypertension, or heart\n             failure.\n\n          -  4. Any condition which, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, would prevent\n             full participation in this trial or would interfere with the evaluation of the trial\n             endpoints.\n\n          -  5.
