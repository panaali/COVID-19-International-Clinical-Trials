            "textblock": "Immunotherapy based on Adoptive Cellular Transfer (ACT) uses several types of immune cells,\n      including dendritic cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, lymphokine-activated killer cells, and NK\n      cells. NK cell-based immunotherapies are an attractive approach for treating diseases because\n      of their characteristic recognition and killing mechanisms; they are involved in the early\n      defense against infectious pathogens and against MHC class-I-negative or -low-expressing\n      targets without the requirement for prior immune sensitization of the host and are able to\n      lyse target through the release of perforin and granzymes and using antibody-dependent\n      cellular cytotoxicity pathways mediated by Fc receptor for IgG (CD16).\n\n      The aim of this project is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of allogeneic NK cells\n      from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of healthy donors in patients infected with\n      COVID-19 collected by apheresis. This allows us to collect cGMP PBMCs and immunomagnetic\n      remove several types of undesirable cells including B, T and CD33+ cells with enrichment of\n      NK cells that will be expanded in bioreactors with GMP culture media (AIM-V) supplemented\n      with human AB serum and GMP grade IL-2, and IL-15. After quality control verification the\n      final NK cell product will be resuspended in 300 mL saline solution for intravenous infusion.\n      Initially, we will enroll in this study ten COVID-19 infected adult patients with moderate\n      symptoms (NEWS 2 scale score>4). Consent forms will be signed by the patient before the\n      therapy. Patients will be treated with three different infusions of NK cells 48 h apart with\n      1, 10, and 20 million cells/kg body weight. We will follow the patients for any adverse\n      effect, clinical response and immune effects by flow cytometry including markers for NK cells\n      expressing different markers (CD158b, NKG2A, and IFN-y). We anticipated that the release of\n      IFN-y by exogenous NK cells could attract other immune cell populations to boost the immune\n      response against COVID-19."
