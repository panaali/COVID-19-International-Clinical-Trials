It is the intention of this study,\n      driven by the ongoing pandemic as a direct causative etiology for permanent lung damage\n      within the oxygen/carbon dioxide exchange resulting the the direct alveolar disruption and\n      scarring reaction.\n\n      The inflammatory mediation, autoimmune modulatory capabilities, and revascularization\n      potentials of the cSVF is becoming well recognized and documented in peer-reviewed literature\n      and in scientific studies.\n\n      Due to the urgency presented from the ongoing CoronaVirus pandemic, many patients that\n      survive experience demonstrate direct pulmonary damage residua.

This study examines the lung baseline (post-infection), and at 3 and 6 month\n      intervals post-cSVF treatment to examine the functional airway configuration and efficiency\n      at those intervals.\n\n      Sporadic reports of use of stem cells or stem/stromal cells have revealed some positive\n      clinical outcomes, although not within a traditional randomized trial format at this point in\n      time. This study proposed in the specific situation of permanent residual dysfunction created\n      by the SARS-Co2 (Coronavirus) infection is felt to warrant a pilot study using the cSVF that\n      is in current Clinical Trials, which, at this point presents a very good safety profile with\n      the absence of adverse event (AE) or severe adverse events (SAE) as yet reported by the\n      trials."}, "overall_status": "Enrolling by invitation", "start_date": {"@type": "Actual", "#text": "March 25, 2020"}, "completion_date": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "December 31, 2021"}, "primary_completion_date": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "November 1, 2021"}, "phase": "Early Phase 1", "study_type": "Interventional", "has_expanded_access": "No", "study_design_info": {"allocation": "Non-Randomized", "intervention_model": "Parallel Assignment", "primary_purpose": "Treatment", "masking": "None (Open Label)"}, "primary_outcome": {"measure": "Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events", "time_frame": "1 month", "description": "Reporting of Adverse Events or Severe Adverse Events Assessed by CTCAE v4.0"}, "secondary_outcome": [{"measure": "Pulmonary Function Analysis", "time_frame": "baseline, 3 Month, 6 months", "description": "High Resolution Computerized Tomography of Lung (HRCT Lung) for Fluidda Analysis comparative at baseline and 3 and 6 months post-treatment comparative analytics"}, {"measure": "Digital Oximetry", "time_frame": "3 months, 6 months", "description": "Finger Pulse Oximetry taken before and after 6 minute walk on level ground, compare desaturation tendency"}], "number_of_arms": "5", "enrollment": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "10"}, "condition": ["Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis", "COPD", "Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis", "Viral Pneumonia", "Coronavirus Infection", "Interstitial Lung Disease"], "arm_group": [{"arm_group_label": "Lipoaspiration", "arm_group_type": "Experimental", "description": "Closed sterile, disposable microcannula of small volume adipose tissue, including the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) (cells and stromal tissue"}, {"arm_group_label": "Isolation & Concentration of cSVF", "arm_group_type": "Experimental", "description": "Isolation & Concentration of cellular stromal vascular fraction (cSVF) using Healeon Centricyte 1000 Centrifuge, incubator and shaker plate with sterile Liberase enzyme (Roche Medical) per manufacturer protocols"}, {"arm_group_label": "Delivery cSVF via Intravenous", "arm_group_type": "Experimental", "description": "cSVF from Arm 2 is suspended in a 250 cc of sterile Normal Saline IV solution and deployed though 150 micron in-line filtration and intravenous route over 30-60 minute timeframe"}, {"arm_group_label": "Liberase TM", "arm_group_type": "Other", "description": "Use of sterile Liberase TM enzyme to allow cSVF separation and isolation"}, {"arm_group_label": "Sterile Normal Saline", "arm_group_type": "Other", "description": "250 cc of sterile Normal Saline for Intravenous with sterile 150 micron in-line filtration for suspension of the concentrated cSVF and deployment IV"}], "intervention": [{"intervention_type": "Procedure", "intervention_name": "Microcannula Harvest Adipose Derived tissue stromal vascular fraction (tSVF)", "description": "Use of Disposable Microcannula Closed System (Tulip Med, 2.2 mm) Harvest of Autologous Adipose Stroma and Stem/Stromal Cell Content", "arm_group_label": "Lipoaspiration"}, {"intervention_type": "Device", "intervention_name": "Centricyte 1000", "description": "Centricyte 1000 (Healeon Medical) Digestive (sterile Roche Liberase TM) Isolation/Concentration Protocol, Rinsing/Neutralization, and Pelletize the cSVF For Deployment Via Sterile Saline IV fluid Standard Protocol", "arm_group_label": ["Isolation & Concentration of cSVF", "Liberase TM"]}, {"intervention_type": "Procedure", "intervention_name": "IV Deployment Of cSVF In Sterile Normal Saline IV Solution", "description": "Sterile Normal Saline Suspension cSVF in 250cc for Intravenous Delivery Including Use of 150 micron in-line filtration", "arm_group_label": ["Delivery cSVF via Intravenous", "Sterile Normal Saline"]}, {"intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Liberase Enzyme (Roche)", "description": "Sterile Collagenase Blend to separate cSVF from the AD-SVF", "arm_group_label": ["Isolation & Concentration of cSVF", "Liberase TM"], "other_name": "Proteolytic Emzyme"}, {"intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Sterile Normal Saline for Intravenous Use", "description": "Sterile Normal Saline IV solution to provide suspension of cSVF in 250 cc via standard IV line, including sterile 150 micron in-line standard filter", "arm_group_label": ["Delivery cSVF via Intravenous", "Sterile Normal Saline"], "other_name": "Suspensory Fluid for cSVF"}], "eligibility": {"criteria": {"textblock": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n          -
