Piclidenoson will be administered on an empty stomach,\n      i.e, 1 hour before or 2 hours after eating. Patients' vital signs (temperature, blood\n      pressure, pulse rate per minute, breath rate per minute and oxygen saturation), will be\n      monitored according to standard of care (SoC). Symptom questionnaires will be collected from\n      patients once daily during the period of hospitalization. Efficacy of Piclidenoson will be\n      assessed by analysis of COVID-19 (Fluxergy, Irvine CA), in respiratory secretions obtained by\n      nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, collected consecutively at day 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 21\n      and 28 following initial diagnosis, in addition to its effect on different clinical outcomes.\n      Safety and tolerability of Piclidenoson will be assessed by AE monitoring, vital signs and\n      ECG assessment and clinical laboratory tests (CBC, and extended chemistry panel)."
