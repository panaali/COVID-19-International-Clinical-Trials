So the investigators\n      hypothesize that this health crisis is an opportunity to develop risk reduction and access to\n      care for vulnerable people who lives with an addiction.\n\n      The main objective of this study is to describe the changes in the psychoactive substances\n      consumption during the containement in people suffering from addcition. The secondary\n      objectives are to describe the evolution at 1 month from the end of the containement of\n      problematic consumption and the level of access to care of these users"
