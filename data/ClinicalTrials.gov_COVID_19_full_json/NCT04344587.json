The purpose of this trial is to investigate the use\n      of prone positioning in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients who are not intubated. It is unknown if\n      this intervention would be helpful in preventing further respiratory deterioration in terms\n      of increasing supplemental oxygen requirements, endotracheal intubation, and ICU admission.\n      The CATNAP Study is a pragmatic adaptive randomized controlled unblinded trial. CATNAP\n      compares a smartphone tool that recommends non-ICU patients with COVID-19 or who are under\n      evaluation for COVID-19 to lie in a prone position (i.e, with their stomach and chest facing\n      down) to usual care."
