            "textblock": "The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a new strain of coronavirus found in human in 2019,\n      which causes epidemic worldwide. Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) causes acute lung\n      injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the severe and critically\n      severe patients. Pulmonary edema is the key detrimental feature of ALI/ARDS. Autopsy of\n      patients died from COVID-19 reported that, pulmonary mucus exudation was severe, more obvious\n      than SARS infection. Pulmonary CT scanning and pathological findings also suggest that\n      pulmonary edema caused by inflammatory exudation is a distinguished feature of COVID-19.\n      However, specific pharmacotherapy is lacking.Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is\n      known as the most potent inducing factors to increase vascular permeability. Bevacizumab is\n      an anti VEGF recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody, which has been used in anti-tumor\n      treatment for 16 years. Evidence suggest that Bevacizumab is a promising drug for severe and\n      critical COVID-19 patients."
