            "textblock": "New coronavirus infection is an important cause of public health emergencies at home and\n      abroad, which seriously affects people's health and social stability. The outbreak of\n      SRAR-COV in China in 2003 caused serious social impact. From January 2002 to August 7, 2003,\n      there were a total of 8,422 cases worldwide, involving 32 countries and regions, of which 919\n      cases were fatal, with a fatality rate of nearly 11%. The fatality rate of elderly patients\n      and patients with underlying diseases was even more high.There is no precise and effective\n      treatment for coronavirus infection. In vitro, IFN-\u03b12\u03b2 has inhibitory effects on MERS-CoV and\n      closely related coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) -CoV. A study showed the\n      effects of interferon-\u03b12\u03b2 and ribavirin on the replication of nCoV isolates hCoV-EMC / 2012\n      in Vero and LLC-MK2 cells. The combined application may be useful for the management of\n      patients with nCoV infection in the future. At present, the combination therapy of interferon\n      \u03b12\u03b2 and ribavirin has been successfully applied in the initial treatment and prevention of\n      SARS and MERS.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of\n      recombinant human interferon \u03b11\u03b2 in treating patients with new coronavirus infection in\n      Wuhan."

Patients will be allocated in a 1: 1\n      ratio, receiving the interferon alpha treatment group or only the standard treatment group.\n      Patients who do not meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria are only allowed to be\n      re-screened once, provided that the time from symptom onset to randomization remains within 7\n      days.\n\n      This study planned to randomize approximately 328 adult subjects.

Subjects and all research center staff were not blinded.\n\n      The primary endpoint of this study was the incidence of side effects within 14 days of\n      enrollment. Therefore, a 14-day visit is essential for the data needed for this endpoint.\n      Every effort should be made to ensure that this study visit is completed in a timely manner.\n\n      Out-of-hospital treatment or discharge will reach the discharge standard on the day of\n      implementation and will be implemented in accordance with the Health and Medical Commission's\n      \"Unknown Viral Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Plan (Trial)\". For patients treated outside\n      the hospital or who have been discharged, final assessments are performed by phone and using\n      a questionnaire (if applicable)."
