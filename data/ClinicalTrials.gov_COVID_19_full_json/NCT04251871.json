            "textblock": "In December 2019, a cluster of patients with pneumonia in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel\n      betacoronavirus, which named the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). It was frequently\n      reported that 2019-nCoV could be a public health crisis with high infectiousness, and it\n      naturally spread across the country. Most of patients with 2019-nCoV infection were found to\n      have non-specific symptoms including fever, cough, myalgia and fatigue. In addition, some\n      patients were more likely to develop severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute\n      respiratory syndrome (SARS), or even die. However, there was no timely and effective\n      treatment of patients with 2019-nCoV infection. Traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs), are\n      derived from plants and usually incorporate one or more herbs as the basic drug(s) to treat\n      the disease. An RCT was performed to investigate TCM was effective and safe for treating\n      2019-nCoV infection. Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio, and 1 subject on\n      conventional medicines and TCMs granules for every 1 subject on conventional medicines.\n      According to recommendations for prevention and control of pneumonia cause by 2019-nCoV\n      infection from China National Health Commission, conventional medicines involve oxygen\n      therapy and antiviral therapy (alfa interferon via aerosol inhalation, and\n      lopinavir/ritonavir, p.o). Additionally, planned interim analysis will be performed, because\n      the prevention and control of 2019-nCoV infection might affect estimated enrollment."
