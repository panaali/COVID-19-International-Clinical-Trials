            "textblock": "The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has placed tremendous stress on the global\n      economy since its outbreak in December 2019. Currently, with nearly 1.3 million confirmed\n      cases, there is still no effective way to contain the disease. The transmission of COVID-19\n      occurs via direct (prolonged close interaction, within 2 meters for more than 30 minutes) and\n      indirect (fomites) contacts. Locally, the risk of COVID-19 infection in household contacts of\n      confirmed cases is about 4%. These at-risk individuals are identified through contact tracing\n      and infectious may be preventable using post-exposure-prophylaxis (PEP). However, there has\n      yet to be a single effective, safe, and affordable pharmacological agent with such\n      capabilities. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a cheap anti-malarial and immunomodulatory agent\n      which may potentially be used as PEP against COVID-19. HCQ is capable of blocking the\n      invasion and intracellular replication of the virus. Existing studies have reported efficacy\n      of HCQ in treating COVID-19, with reduced time to clinical recovery and few reports of\n      patients suffering from significant side effects. However, existing studies are largely\n      limited by their small sample sizes. Furthermore, there has yet to be a published trial on\n      HCQ's role in PEP. This cluster randomized trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of\n      oral HCQ PEP, taken over for 5 days, in reducing the number of infected household contacts of\n      confirmed COVID-19 patients under home quarantine. Comparison will be made between HCQ PEP\n      (treatment group) and no treatment (control group). Subjects will be followed up over a\n      course of 28 days, with daily symptom monitoring conducted over phone calls. Positive\n      outcomes from this study will provide a means for us to battle the COVID-19 pandemic."
