A recent study conducted at The Everett Clinic showed that foam nasal swabs were\n      able to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus at comparable levels to nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs. We now\n      look to build of this work by comparing polyester foam swabs, which are more readily\n      available and mass producible, to foam nasal swabs, in their sensitivity for detecting\n      SARS-CoV-2 virus. We also plan to assess the viability of dry swabbing, where the swab is\n      stored without saline or viral transport media (VTM) at room temperature for four days, to\n      calculate the degradation of the viral sample. Finally, we will collect up to 50 mL/visit of\n      blood longitudinally from patients who have previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at\n      visit one, two, and four weeks following their initial COVID-10 diagnosis These longitudinal\n      blood samples will help us gain a better understanding of the trajectory of COVID-19 (in\n      terms of both clinical symptomology and viral load) and antibody development. At each visit,\n      nasal swabs and blood samples will be collected, and the blood samples will be stored in a\n      repository for future research."
