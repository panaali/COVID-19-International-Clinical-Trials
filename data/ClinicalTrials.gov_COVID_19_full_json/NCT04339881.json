It is important to\n      understand the spread of the virus within the hospital. This will help to optimize procedures\n      to prevent transmission to caregivers and hospitalizedpatients not infected with SARS Cov2,\n      and more generally this will contribute to control the spread of SARS Cov2 in the community"
