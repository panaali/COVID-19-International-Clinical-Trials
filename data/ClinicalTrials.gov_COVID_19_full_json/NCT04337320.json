Parameters examined in Apgar score Muscle tone, Heart rate, Reflexes, Skin color, Respiration.\nIn the Apgar score, the baby is evaluated and scores are collected.\n7 - 10: The baby is normal.\n4 - 6: They usually recover with respiratory support.\n0 - 3: Urgent intervention and resuscitation is needed.\nThe low Apgar score in the 1st minute usually returns to normal in the 5th minute with support. Despite the intervention, the Apgar scores of 5 and less at 5 and 10 minutes are associated with an increased risk of mortality and cerebral palsy."
