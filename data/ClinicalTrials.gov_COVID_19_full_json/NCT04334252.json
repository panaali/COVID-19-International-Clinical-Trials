Due to the relatively high number of diagnosed,\n      symptomatic infections despite a strict policy, we expect a high prevalence of COVID 19\n      throughout the entire population. The risk that an asymptomatic carrier transfers the virus\n      to others is very high. This risk is even higher during surgery, where intubation is\n      necessary. Therefore we would like to pre-screen all patients pre-operatively on the presence\n      of COVID 19 before surgery since there is no consensus for screening at the moment. The\n      golden standard is the SARS CoV-2 PCR on the nasopharyngeal sample together with a CT scan of\n      the lungs. On top of this standard of care screening, we will perform a questionnaire at the\n      pre-operative visit which evaluates the possible occurence of certain symptoms in the last 2\n      weeks. These symptoms are fever, anorexia, cough, diarrhea, sneezing, vomiting, dyspnea,\n      headache, rhinorrhea, loss of smell, muscle pain, sputum, sore throat and fatigue. Patients\n      were also asked if one of their housemates are affected by these symptoms. Furthermore, 2\n      weeks after surgery, patient will be contacted to phone in order to fill the same\n      questionnaire."}, "overall_status": "Not yet recruiting", "start_date": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "April 17, 2020"}, "completion_date": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "December 20, 2023"}, "primary_completion_date": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "December 20, 2022"}, "study_type": "Observational", "has_expanded_access": "No", "study_design_info": {"observational_model": "Cohort", "time_perspective": "Prospective"}, "primary_outcome": [{"measure": "Prevalence of symptoms", "time_frame": "at the pre-operative consultation", "description": "Prevalence of fever, cough, anorexia, fatigue, diarrhea, vomiting, dyspnee, sore throat and sputum"}, {"measure": "Prevalence of positive Sars CoV-2 PCR", "time_frame": "at the pre-operative consultation", "description": "Prevalence of positive COVID 19 tests in patients planned for surgery"}, {"measure": "Prevalence of positive radiological findings", "time_frame": "at the pre-operative consultation", "description": "Prevalence of positive radiological findings in CT scans of the lungs of patients planned for surgery"}], "secondary_outcome": [{"measure": "Prediction of symptoms", "time_frame": "2 weeks after surgery", "description": "Prediction of symptoms of COVID 19, based on evaluated baseline questionnaire"}, {"measure": "Prediction of symptoms", "time_frame": "2 weeks after surgery", "description": "Prediction of symptoms of COVID 19, based on radiological findings of CT scans"}, {"measure": "Prediction of symptoms", "time_frame": "2 weeks after surgery", "description": "Prediction of symptoms of COVID 19, based on COVID 19 PCR results"}], "enrollment": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "5000"}, "condition": "COVID 19", "intervention": {"intervention_type": "Other", "intervention_name": "Questionnaire", "description": "Questionnaire"}, "eligibility": {"study_pop": {"textblock": "All adult patients scheduled for a surgery in the Jessa hospital and seen at the\n        pre-operative consultation will be asked to participate and to fullfill the questionnaire"}, "sampling_method": "Non-Probability Sample", "criteria": {"textblock": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  All adult patients > 18 years undergoing surgery in the Jessa hospital\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Patients < 18 years\n\n          -  Adult patients who are unable the give informed consent\n\n          -  Language barrier"}, "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "Accepts Healthy Volunteers"}, "overall_contact": {"last_name": "Janneke Cox, Dr", "phone": "03211 33 76 51", "email": "janneke.cox@jessazh.be"}, "overall_contact_backup": {"last_name": "Ina Callebaut, dr", "phone": "003211339848", "email": "ina.callebaut@jessazh.be"}, "verification_date": "April 2020", "study_first_submitted": "April 2, 2020", "study_first_submitted_qc": "April 3, 2020", "study_first_posted": {"@type": "Estimate", "#text": "April 6, 2020"}, "last_update_submitted": "April 3, 2020", "last_update_submitted_qc": "April 3, 2020", "last_update_posted": {"@type": "Estimate", "#text": "April 6, 2020"}, "responsible_party": {"responsible_party_type": "Principal Investigator", "investigator_affiliation": "Jessa Hospital", "investigator_full_name": "Ina Callebaut", "investigator_title": "dr"}, "patient_data": {"sharing_ipd": "No"}}}
