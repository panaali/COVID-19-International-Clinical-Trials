This new coronavirus causes a disease presentation which has now been named\n      COVID-19. The virus has subsequently spread throughout the world and was declared a pandemic\n      by the World Health Organisation on 11th March 2020. As of 18 March 2020, there are 198,193\n      number of confirmed cases with an estimated case-fatality of 3%. There is no approved therapy\n      for COVID-19 and the current standard of care is supportive treatment.\n\n      SARS-CoV-2 exploits the cell entry receptor protein angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE-2)\n      to access and infect human cells. The interaction between ACE2 and the spike protein is not\n      in the active site. This process requires the serine protease TMPRSS2. Camostat Mesilate is a\n      potent serine protease inhibitor. Utilizing research on severe acute respiratory syndrome\n      coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the closely related SARS-CoV-2 cell entry mechanism, it has been\n      demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry can be blocked by camostat mesilate. In mice,\n      camostat mesilate dosed at concentrations similar to the clinically achievable concentration\n      in humans reduced mortality following SARS-CoV infection from 100% to 30-35%."}, "overall_status": "Recruiting", "start_date": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "March 31, 2020"}, "completion_date": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "May 1, 2021"}, "primary_completion_date": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "December 31, 2020"}, "phase": "Phase 1/Phase 2", "study_type": "Interventional", "has_expanded_access": "No", "study_design_info": {"allocation": "Randomized", "intervention_model": "Parallel Assignment", "primary_purpose": "Treatment", "masking": "Quadruple (Participant, Care Provider, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)", "masking_description": "Placebo-controlled"}, "primary_outcome": {"measure": "Days to clinical improvement from study enrolment", "time_frame": "30 days", "description": "Clinical improvement defined as live hospital discharge OR a 2 point improvement (from time of enrolment) in disease severity rating on the 7-point ordinal scale"}, "secondary_outcome": [{"measure": "Safety evaluation, as measured by AEs, Adverse Reactions (ARs), SAEs, Serious ARs (SARs)", "time_frame": "30 days"}, {"measure": "Clinical status as assessed by the 7-point ordinal scale at day 7, 14 and 30", "time_frame": "30 days", "description": "The ordinal scale is an assessment of the clinical status at the first assessment of a given study day.
