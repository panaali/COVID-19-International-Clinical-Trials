Coronavirus pandemic\n      put a lot of lives at stake. By 19 March 2020, a total of 219238 confirmed cases with 8967\n      being dead and 85742 recovered cases have been reported. Worldwide, in 9 days, the confirmed\n      death cases have been doubled. The average death rate of Covid-19 per day is approximately 88\n      patients as of the given date. Unlike, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the disease progression and\n      mortality rate of Covid-19 is startling. The pre-pathogenic course of novel Covid-19 is yet\n      to be determined, so the risk factors, clinical picture and medical intervention too. Only\n      supportive therapy is being practised. Yet many trials of antimalarial drug, chloroquine and\n      quinolone is currently taking place worldwide. According to Cortegiani A, 23 ongoing trials\n      from China have been registered. Clinical experience from recent Wuhan epidemic came up with\n      promising results of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in Covid-19 positive patients. Some\n      in-vitro studies suggest that these immunomodulant drugs can interfere with SARS-nCov-2\n      replication. These are federal drug authority approved medicine for malaria. Yet their\n      effectiveness and safety in treating Covid-19 pneumonia is a question mark."
