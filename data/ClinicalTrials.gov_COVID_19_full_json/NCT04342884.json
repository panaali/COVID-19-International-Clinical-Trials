Investigators will\n      conduct real-time syndromic respiratory disease surveillance and, for SARS-CoV-2 infections,\n      calculate baseline seroprevalence and seroconversion rates, hazard risks from close contacts,\n      estimate efficacy of personal protective equipment, and assess sequelae incidence.\n      Investigators will utilize the COVID-19 Therapeutic Learning System, an Oracle developed\n      self-reporting data collection system that can be easily modified to address these specific\n      questions. Over the course of the study, volunteers will report daily exposures, risk\n      reduction behaviors, and symptoms through a secure app on their smartphone, tablet, or\n      computer. In addition to daily syndromic surveillance, at baseline and once every month after\n      that we will use a serologic IgM/G test kit to identify infections and reinfections in\n      volunteers and send results to the Oracle developed database. The areas covered by this study\n      are experiencing community spread of COVID-19 but are early enough in the epidemic to capture\n      potentially a significant number of seroconversions over the 12 months of the study. This\n      surveillance model will be expanded to include the clients and health workers of other\n      medical agencies in North Carolina and in other states."
