The clinical presentations\n      are variable widely, ranging from simple rhinitis to major lung damage that can lead to\n      death.\n\n      In many countries involved in the ongoing health disaster due to SARS-CoV-2 infection,\n      hospital are overloaded. In this context, the decision to hospitalize or to manage COVID-19\n      patients at home is crucial and defining reliable and consensual criteria is a major issue.\n\n      HOME-CoV study is a multicentre quasi-experimental interventional study, before and after\n      implementation of a help-decision making rule (HOME-CoV rule), developed via the Delphi\n      method.\n\n      Our main hypothesis is that a strategy based on the consensual HOME-CoV rule compared to\n      current practice is at least as safe as regards the 7-day-rate of adverse events (safety\n      criterion) and more effective as regards the rate of patients eventually managed as\n      outpatients (efficacy criterion)."
