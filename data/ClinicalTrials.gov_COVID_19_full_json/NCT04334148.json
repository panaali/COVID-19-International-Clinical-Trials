Eligible participants will be randomly assigned (1:1)\n      to either treatment group (HCQ) or placebo in a double-blind fashion. After enrollment,\n      baseline assessments will include nasopharyngeal swab for COVID-19 and a blood sample to\n      detect seroconversion to COVID-19. For convenience, follow-up will be performed weekly\n      through a direct to participant portal. A call center will provide support for any missed\n      visits. Follow-up includes screening for any COVID-19 clinical infections, other respiratory\n      infections, clinical events, adverse events, and Quality of Life (QoL) assessments. Course of\n      treatment is 30 days. Participants are followed via survey weekly. At the end of treatment\n      participants will return for repeat nasopharyngeal swab for COVID-19 and a blood sample to\n      detect seroconversion to COVID-19. There will be one last contact at 8 weeks (2 months) from\n      baseline."
