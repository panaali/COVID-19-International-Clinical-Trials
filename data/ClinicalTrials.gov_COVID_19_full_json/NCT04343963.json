            "textblock": "In brief, we will evaluate low-dose pyridostigmine as add-on therapy to best medical care in\n      patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who require hospitalization and have at least one of the\n      criteria considered serious. Our hypothesis is that, in comparison to the placebo,\n      pyridostigmine will reduce in at least 10% a composite outcome (death, the requirement for\n      mechanical ventilation, or an increase of 2 points in the SOFA score) by day 28. Our\n      secondary outcome will be the decrease of circulating IL-6 levels from baseline sample to\n      post-intervention day 7.\n\n      In recent publications of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, it was described that between 25%\n      and 33% of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 were admitted to intensive care units (ICU) for\n      severe hypoxemia. The reported mortality in those first cases that required hospital\n      management is 15%, but in those with severe disease, the reported mortality is between 38%\n      and 49%. So far, there is no pharmacological therapeutic (or else) strategy known to reduce\n      morbidity and mortality in these patients. Mortality in COVID-19 appears to be mediated not\n      necessarily by the direct effect of the infection, but by the disproportionate inflammatory\n      response of the host.\n\n      Pyridostigmine is an old drug that, by inhibiting acetylcholine-esterase, the enzymatic\n      machinery that degrades acetylcholine (ACh), results in increased ACh bioavailability. ACh,\n      in turn, ligates to nicotinic-alpha7 receptors in macrophages and T cells, resulting in\n      reduced overactivation of these immune cells. In experimental murine sepsis, this family of\n      drugs has resulted in reduced inflammation and mortality. Human evidence is scarce for severe\n      inflammatory conditions. However, recent evidence from our group and others indicates that\n      pyridostigmine has an immunomodulatory effect in people living with HIV, resulting in\n      elevation of CD4+ T cell counts, decreased immune activation, and reduction in inflammatory\n      mediators (e.g., IFN-g, IL-6, sCD14). Altogether, this suggests that ACh-esterase inhibitors\n      may act as immunomodulators during viral infections, potentially reducing the overt\n      inflammatory cascade (the so-called \"cytokine storm\") observed in critically ill COVID-19\n      patients. So far, Mexico has less than 3,000 diagnosed patients, with about 16% requiring\n      hospital admission. However, we are expecting an upsurge in the next two-to-four weeks.\n\n      We also know that, at the proposed dose (60mg/d), the rate of minor adverse events is less\n      than 5% with no reported serious adverse effects. From that perspective, we consider that\n      pyridostigmine can function as an immuno-modulator and reduce morbidity and mortality in\n      COVID-19-stricken patients, with the added value of a safe pharmacological profile. Moreover,\n      as an old drug, repurposing it for a novel indication may be simpler (and cheaper) than\n      developing a novel one from the ground up."

            "textblock": "The study will be divided into two phases, each with different variables to evaluate, as\n      described below:\n\n      The primary objective of the first phase (proof-of-concept) will be to evaluate the effect of\n      pyridostigmine on the serum level of IL-6 as an indicator of severe inflammation, as well as\n      its kinetics throughout the days that the patient is hospitalized.\n\n      In the first phase we will evaluate the safety and feasibility of the study in a\n      representative sample and we will explore in a preliminary way the magnitude of the effect of\n      the intervention. Safety will be evaluated according to the adverse effects reported in\n      patients with acute intoxication (accidental or in suicide attempt) with pyridostigmine:\n\n        1. Abdominal pain/cramps\n\n        2. Diarrhea\n\n        3. Vomiting, nausea, or both\n\n        4. Hypersalivation\n\n        5. Urinary incontinence\n\n        6. Fasciculations or muscle weakness\n\n        7. Blurred vision\n\n      In the second phase (to be carried out only if the results of the first phase justify it),\n      the primary outcome to be evaluated is mortality, the requirement of invasive or non-invasive\n      mechanical ventilation, or an increase in the SOFA scale \u22652 points.\n\n      The following secondary outcomes were evaluated: changes in the total SOFA score between\n      study entry and evaluation at 3, 7, and 14 days; the number of days of hospital stay, days of\n      hospitalization in the intensive care unit, and the need (and if applicable, the number of\n      days required) for invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation.\n\n      The variables to measure are sex, age at hospitalization, date of COVID-19 diagnosis, date\n      and SOFA scale measurement, date of hospitalization, date of transfer to the intensive care\n      unit, date of initiation of mechanical ventilation. , date and reason for leaving the\n      intensive care unit."
