Preliminary reports suggest potential\n      efficacy in small human studies. Clinical trial data are needed to determine whether\n      hydroxychloroquine is effective in treating COVID-19.\n\n      Study Aim: To compare the effect of hydroxychloroquine versus placebo on clinical outcomes,\n      measured using the COVID Ordinal Outcomes Scale at Day 15, among adults with COVID-19\n      requiring hospitalization.\n\n      Study Hypothesis: Among adults hospitalized with COVID-19, administration of\n      hydroxychloroquine will improve clinical outcomes at Day 15.\n\n      ."
