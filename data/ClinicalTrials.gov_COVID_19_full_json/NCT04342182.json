Immunoglobulins are used for the treatment of CMV disease, and\n      is effective as prophylaxis when given soon after exposure to varicella zoster virus, rabies,\n      and hepatitis B virus.\n\n      Neutralizing antibodies against MERS, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 have been shown to be present\n      in patients previously infected with MERS, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 respectively. During the\n      2003 SARS outbreak in Hong-Kong,a non-randomized study in hospitalized SARS patients showed\n      that treatment with convalescent plasma (convP) from SARS-recovered donors significantly\n      increased the day 22 discharge rate and decreased mortality. A study in non-human primates\n      showed that rhesus macaques could not be re-infected with SARS-CoV-2 after primary infection.\n\n      With no proven effective therapy against COVID-19, this protocol will evaluate the\n      therapeutic potential of therapy with convalescent plasma from COVID-19 recovered donors.\n\n      Primary objectives\n\n      \u2022 Decrease overall mortality in patients within COVID disease\n\n      Study design:\n\n      This trial is a randomized comparative trial. Patients will be randomized between the\n      infusion of 250mL of convP with standard of care.\n\n      Patient population:\n\n      Patients with PCR confirmed COVID disease, age >18 years Donors will be included with a known\n      history of COVID who have been asymptomatic for at least 24 hours.\n\n      Intervention: 250mL of convP Duration of treatment: ConvP will be given as a one-time\n      infusion Duration of follow up: Until discharge or death before day 60, whichever comes first\n\n      Target number of patients: 426 Target number of donors: 100"
