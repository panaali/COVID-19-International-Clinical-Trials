However,there is no\n      specific antiviral therapy for CoVID-19 infection, which provides a window of opportunity for\n      testing candidate antiviral therapies. Previous experiences with SARS and MERS-CoV, highlight\n      the need of the early intervention with Chinese medicine, and so as for CoVID-19 infection.\n      The treatment of Chinese medicine for CoVID-19 infection suggested its benefits to improve of\n      clinical outcomes, reduce the risk of disease progression, accelerate recovery, and reduce\n      intensive supportive care and long-term hospitalization.Yinhu Qingwen Granula was a kind of\n      herbal granula made from \"Yinhu Qingwen Decoction\", which consists of 11 common non-toxic\n      traditional Chinese medicine such as Polygonum cuspidatum, Honeysuckle, Nepeta, Ligustrum\n      lucidum. Previous vivo antiviral studies showed its activity for the inbition of CoVID-19.\n      This clinical trial is planned to evaluate the improvement of the changes in the ratio of\n      PaO2 to FiO2 from the baseline for patients with severe CoVID-19 as the primary outcome, and\n      to evaluate the effect of the symptoms relief and virus clearance as well as the clinical\n      safety."
