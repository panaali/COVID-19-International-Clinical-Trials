The prior version of this software is\n      already being used clinically and is FDA approved. The main reason for using the updated\n      version is that it's faster and better in terms of guiding the user."

            "textblock": "To enable healthcare professionals that are not proficient in transthoracic echo (TTE) to\n      acquire images in patients being evaluated for or positive for COVID-19. By leveraging the\n      capabilities of the Caption AI which is designed to train novice users on how to acquire TTE,\n      this would minimize the risk of sonographers to be exposed to COVID-19. Additionally,\n      minimizing sonographer interaction with patients being evaluated for or positive for COVID 19\n      minimizes the risk of sonographers as vectors for transmission to other patients. Lastly,\n      since the Caption AI device will be dedicated to the COVID wards and COVID ICU and not\n      transported to other locations, use of the CAPTION AI device will help to limit viral\n      transmission via the surfaces of the ultrasound machine. These images will be assessed by\n      qualified medical professionals for diagnosis."
