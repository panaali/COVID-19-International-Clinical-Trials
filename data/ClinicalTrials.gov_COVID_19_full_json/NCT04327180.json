The symptoms can be extremely varied and\n      the course can range from spontaneous healing without sequelae to death.\n\n      Currently, the diagnosis of certainty for resuscitation patients (by definition \"severe\") is\n      based on searching for a fragment of virus genetic material within the epithelial cells of\n      the respiratory tree, up and/or down, by PCR.\n\n      It is to be expected that the epidemic peak will make it difficult (if not impossible) to\n      respect the stereotypical path that is currently in place, due to the lack of space in the\n      specific unit. This will require optimization of care pathways and use of the specific\n      sectors.\n\n      It is therefore necessary to define the simple criteria, available from the moment patients\n      are admitted, to predict the result of the COVID-19 PCR."
