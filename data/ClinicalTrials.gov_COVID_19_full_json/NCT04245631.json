It is now confirmed that the etiology of\n      this outbreak is a novel coronavirus, namely, 2019-nCoV. Of critical importance is rapid and\n      simple diagnostic method to be used in clinical settings to timely inform and refine\n      strategies that can prevent, control, and stop the spread of 2019-nCoV. Recombinase aided\n      amplification (RAA) assay is a novel isothermal nucleic acid amplification technique in\n      recent years, which has a variety of the advantages including high specificity and\n      sensitivity, rapid detection (30 min), low cost, low equipment requirements and simple\n      operation. The has successfully detected a variety of pathogens using this technique. To\n      develop a RAA assay for 2019-nCoV with the advantages of high speed, simple operation and low\n      cost, and overcomes the shortcomings of the existing molecular detection methods. The\n      investigators established a real time reverse-transcription RAA (RT-RAA) assay for detection\n      of 2019-nCoV. This assay was performed at 42\u00b0C within 30min using a portable real-time\n      fluorescence detector, Recombinant plasmids containing conserved ORF1ab genes was used to\n      analyze the specificity and sensitivity. Clinical specimens from patients who were suspected\n      of being infected with 2019-nCoV were used to evaluate the performance of the assay. In\n      parallel, The investigators also used the commercial RT-qPCR assay kit for 2019-nCoV as a\n      reference."
