On the other hand further investigations regarding viral and bacterial\n      coinfections, and response of the immune system will be conducted. This study should serve to\n      improve the understanding of COVID-19, to identify risk factors for a severe clinical course\n      and to obtain further insights into pathophysiology of this new infectious disease."

            "textblock": "In 2019 the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)\n      was identified as the pathogen causing the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Many\n      retrospective studies have been conducted regarding clinical signs and symptoms and clinical\n      course of the disease. In most cases the infection causes only light symptoms of the upper\n      respiratory tract. The infection can also be asymptomatic. However, in some the disease can\n      cause a severe infection of the lower respiratory tract leading to acute respiratory syndrome\n      (ARDS) which can be fatal. Especially elderly people suffer from severe disease whereas\n      children are less compromised.\n\n      In this prospective, monocentric study the investigators include patients of all ages with\n      COVID-19 and also a control group of all ages with respiratory tract infections other than\n      COVID-19. Initial presentation, clinical course, outcome and the therapy used will be\n      recorded. Standard diagnostic procedures (vital signs, results of blood samples, blood gas\n      analysis, x ray, ct scan) will also be recorded. To further characterise the study population\n      naso- and oropharyngeal swabs will be checked for viral and bacterial coinfections. The\n      SARS-CoV-2 viral load will be estimated. To characterise the immunological response IgM- and\n      IgG-antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 will be measured. Moreover lymphocyte typing, cytokine and\n      chemokine analysis will be conducted. The investigators will also include an analysis of the\n      proteome in serum and urine. To characterise the virus-host-interaction HLA analysis of the\n      patients will be conducted. In the case of a medically indicated bronchoscopy bronchoalveolar\n      lavage will be analysed in regards of viral load, coinfections, lymphocyte typing and\n      cytokines / chemokines. In case of a medically indicated lung biopsy or in a post mortem lung\n      biopsy a histological analysis will be made.\n\n      In general, samples will be analysed at the initial presentation and after two weeks. Further\n      analysis will be conducted depending on special events like clinical deterioration. Long-term\n      follow up will be ensured by telephone visits."
