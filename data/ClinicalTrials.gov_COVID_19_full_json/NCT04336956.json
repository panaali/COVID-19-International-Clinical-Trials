            "textblock": "In early December 2019, cases of pneumonia of unknown origin were reported in Wuhan, Hubei\n      Province in the People's Republic of China. The disease spreads rapidly and the number of\n      sick people is increasing. On January 3, 2020 a new virus of the coronavirus family is\n      identified in samples of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from a patient in Wuhan and\n      subsequently confirmed as the cause of these pneumonias. On 7 January 2020, the World Health\n      Organization (WHO) designated it as the new coronavirus 2019 (i.e. 2019-nCoV). On 11 February\n      2020, the WHO designated the disease associated with 2019-nCoV as coronavirus 2019 disease\n      (COVID-19). On 12 March, WHO announced that the COVID-19 outbreak is a pandemic.\n\n      As of March 24, 2020, more than 375,000 cases of COVID-19 had been diagnosed with more than\n      16,000 deaths attributed to this virus. (Ref WHO\n      https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019 ).\n\n      In France, the number of cases rose from 105 cases at the end of February to 19615 confirmed\n      cases on March 24. (Source Public Health France). Most of the cases are adults. However,\n      children are not completely spared and serious cases have been described. These severe cases\n      can be respiratory or extra-respiratory (e.g. myocarditis). We also know that pediatric and\n      adult cases differ in terms of clinical, biological and imaging findings, particularly chest\n      CT scans. However, the description of paediatric pictures, especially severe forms and the\n      involvement of children suffering from co-morbidities, remains poorly reported. Finally, the\n      risk factors for serious cases in children remain largely unknown.\n\n      This observatory aim to describe the clinical phenotypes of hospitalized pediatric patients\n      with Covid19 in France, according to age groups."
