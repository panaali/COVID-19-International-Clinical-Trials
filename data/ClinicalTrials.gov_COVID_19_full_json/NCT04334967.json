            "textblock": "Hydroxychloroquine has primarily been raised as a potential treatment of SARS-Cov-2 based on\n      in vitro antiviral activity. A draft paper was released recently in March by Didier Raoult\n      from Aix-Marseille University in France on a preliminary trial of 36 COVID-19 patients. In\n      this trial, 6 patients were asymptomatic, 22 had upper respiratory symptoms, and 8 had lower\n      respiratory symptoms. Between early and mid-March, they treated 20 of these patients with 600\n      mg of hydroxychloroquine daily in a hospital setting. Some patient also received the\n      antibiotic azithromycin. 16 patients served as the controls. They observed a significant\n      reduction in viral load in patients with hydroxychloroquine. After 6 days, 70% of the treated\n      patients were considered cured (no virus detected in their samples) compared to 12.5% of\n      controls. All 6 patients who received both hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were negative\n      for the virus after 6 days. This was an unblinded, non-randomized trial.\n\n      Vitamin C has multiple in-vivo effects on immune modulation that may, in sum, limit the\n      development of the cytokine excess associated with critical illness. It is currently being\n      studied in a clinical trial as a treatment for severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in China and\n      recommended as a supplement in standard treatment of COVID-19.\n\n      There are no medications currently approved for treatment of COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine is\n      a known drug with low toxicity that may reduce progression of respiratory symptoms and\n      resulting hospitalizations. This randomized control study will assess its potential as an\n      off-label treatment in reducing the rates of hospitalization and subsequent mechanical\n      ventilation from COVID-19 infection compared to standard of care treatment with Vitamin C. A\n      randomized control trial with placebo is impractical due to the increasing availability of\n      this medication to the public."
