            "textblock": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are the largest group of viruses belonging to the Nidovirales order.\n      They are enveloped, non-segmented positive-sense RNA viruses.\n\n      Coronavirus are believed to cause a significant proportion of all common colds in adults and\n      children. The Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), also known as Wuhan coronavirus, causes the\n      2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease. The initial cases of 2019-nCoV occurred in Wuahn, China\n      in December 2019.\n\n      A recent review evaluated the potential impact of 2019-nCoV in pregnancy. The authors\n      reported published data on CoVs in pregnant women, including 2019-nCoV, severe acute\n      respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-COV). The review\n      included 12 women with SARS-COV,4 11 women MERS-COV,5 and 9 women with 2019-n-CoV6 in\n      pregnancy. No cases of vertical trasmission were reported, but the authors showed an high\n      rate of preterm birth (45.8%), cesarean delivery (70.8%), maternal admission to intensive\n      care unit (ICU) (63.3%), and maternal death (18.8%).\n\n      The aim of this study was to evaluate the pregnancy and perinatal outcomes of pregnant women\n      with 2019-n-CoV.\n\n      This was a multicenter, retrospective, cohort study. Clinical records and compiled data of\n      all consecutive hospitalized and outpatient pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed\n      2019-n-CoV Data on recent exposure history, clinical symptoms or signs, laboratory findings,\n      and maternal and perinatal outcomes were collected. All medical recors were sent to the\n      coordinator center. Data were entered into a computerized database and cross-checked. If the\n      core data were missing, requests for clarification were sent to the coordinators."
