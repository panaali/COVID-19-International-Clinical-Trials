Hospitalized COVID-19-positive patients requiring ICU care is\n      increasing along with the course of epidemic. A large number of these patients developed\n      acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) according to current data. However, the related\n      hemodynamic characteristic has so far been rarely described."

            "textblock": "The outbreak of COVID-19 is a worldwide concern. To our knowledge, the details of the\n      hemodynamic characteristics of COVID-19 patients have not yet been well described. Besides,\n      the cardiac injury was reported in about 7-17% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in\n      previous Chinese publications and is much more common in patients admitted to ICU and\n      non-survivors. However, no systematic assessment, including echocardiography evaluating the\n      left ventricular function of these patients has been declared. In addition, extravascular\n      lung water (EVLW) and pulmonary capillary permeability are two hall markers in ARDS patient's\n      management, and transpulmonary thermodilution is a validated method to provide these values\n      at the bedside. However, no study has reported the characteristic profile of these variables\n      during ARDS caused by SARS-Cov2. A better knowledge of these characteristics would also be\n      helpful in guiding their management."
