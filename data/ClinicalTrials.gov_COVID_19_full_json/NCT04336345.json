As of this time,\n      there had been 367 total confirmed cases of COVID-19, including four deaths in Mexico. The\n      clinical manifestations of patients with COVID-19 are wide, asymptomatic infection, mild\n      upper respiratory tract illness, and approximately 5% of critically ill patients with\n      COVID-19 have presented rapidly progressive respiratory failure, development of acute\n      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. On March 24,\n      2020, the Secretary of Health of Mexico, formally declared the beginning of phase 2. It has\n      been estimated that many confirmed cases of COVID-19 would occur, thus would result in a\n      significant increase of hospital and ICU admissions."
