We will measure RAS, serum\n      potassium and collect data on the treatment of these patients (especially antihypertensive\n      therapy) one week apart (at the patient'entry into hospital and 7 days later).\n\n      This is a preliminary study that could possibly allow the start of a therapeutic trial in\n      order to test the effectiveness of RAS blocker treatments in this condition."
