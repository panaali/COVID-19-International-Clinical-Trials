More than 70000\n      people were infected and over 2000 people died all over the world. There is no specific drug\n      treatment for this disease. Considering that lung damage is related to both viral infection\n      and burst of cytokines, our idea is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of escin as add-on\n      treatment to conventional antiviral drugs in COVID-19 infected patients."
