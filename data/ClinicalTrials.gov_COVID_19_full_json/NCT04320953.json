Direct contact between doctors and patients in\n      daily practice bears potential risk of Covid-19 infection, and telemedicine, or non-contact\n      medicine, in this circumstance, offers an ideal solution. Remote controlling capsule\n      endoscopy system for gastric examination was recently developed and applicated in clinical\n      practice."

This feasibility study aims to evaluate the\n      technical success, clinical success and adverse events of the first clinical application of\n      non-contact MCE system."
