            "textblock": "Worries about the immediate and long-term consequences of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic are\n      largely justified in the current climate of uncertainty. However, dysfunctional worry, that\n      is, pervasive worry that is disproportionate in its intensity or duration, and that\n      significantly interferes with every-day problem-solving or goal-driven behavior, is clearly\n      counterproductive. Research has also indicated that repeated media exposure to a community\n      crisis can lead to increased anxiety and heightened stress responses, that can give a\n      downstream effect on health, and misplaced health-protective and help-seeking behaviors\n      which, in turn, may overburden health care facilities. There is an urgent need to develop a\n      brief, scalable intervention to target such dysfunctional worry in the general population.\n\n      The current randomized controlled trial will evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a brief\n      online-delivered cognitive behavioral intervention designed to target dysfunctional worry\n      related to the Covid-19 pandemic. 670 individuals are randomized to intervention or to\n      waiting-list. The hypothesis is that the brief self-guided intervention will show significant\n      within-group reductions in self-rated worry from baseline (week 0) to post-treatment (week\n      3), and that these improvements will be larger than those seen in the wait-list control\n      group. The wait-list group will be crossed over to receive the intervention after three weeks\n      (post-treatment). All participants will be followed-up one month and one year after the end\n      of the intervention."
