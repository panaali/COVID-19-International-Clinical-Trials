Normalization of vital signs\n\n      IV. Time to discharge (if hospitalized)\n\n      V. Assessment of agent toxicity as measured by standard metrics\n\n      VI. Collection of nasal swab and blood for viral load, presence of IgM or IgG antibodies\n\n      VII. If feasible on samples collected for quantitative PCR decrease in virus shedding (in\n      nasopharyngeal secretions)\n\n      VIII.

Routine standard of care labs obtained as part of the care of these patients such as\n      differential white count, CRP, troponin and LFTs will be analyzed for correlative trends"
