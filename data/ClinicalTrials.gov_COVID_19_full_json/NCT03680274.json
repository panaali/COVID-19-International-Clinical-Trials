The burden of sepsis is increasing worldwide. It is the cause of 8 million global\n      deaths each year. Currently, treatment options are limited to antimicrobials and supportive\n      care such as intravenous fluids, vasopressors, mechanical ventilation, and renal replacement\n      therapy. In the absence of effective therapies specifically targeting the dysregulated immune\n      response, prolonged use of these life-sustaining therapies can be debilitating. A growing\n      body of evidence suggesting that vitamin C, an inexpensive and readily available\n      intervention, is potentially lifesaving in sepsis. Intravenous vitamin C may be the first\n      therapy to mitigate the dysregulated cascade of events that leads to sepsis. If proven\n      effective, vitamin C could be used worldwide and drastically change outcomes in high- and\n      low-income settings alike.\n\n      Objectives. To determine whether intravenous vitamin C, compared to placebo, reduces\n      mortality and morbidity in sepsis (induced by bacterial and viral pathogens (as COVID-19)),\n      and compare clinical and biochemical measures of organ dysfunction, and health-related\n      quality of life (HRQoL) at 6 months. To ascertain the volume of distribution, clearance, and\n      plasma concentration over a course of 96 hours of intravenous vitamin C 50 mg/kg of weight\n      every 6 hours or matching placebo (pharmacokinetic (PK) substudy).\n\n      Methods. Patients will be randomly assigned to vitamin C (intravenous, 50 mg/kg every 6h) or\n      placebo (0.9% NaCl or dextrose 5% in water) for 96 hours. Study personnel at the clinical\n      sites will document the composite of death or persistent organ dysfunction at day 28. Daily\n      assessments will occur for organ function, on days 1, 3, 7 for inflammation, infection, and\n      endothelial injury biomarkers, at baseline for vitamin C level, and at 6 months for mortality\n      and HRQoL. The LOVIT Trial will be conducted in adult general Canadian and international\n      intensive care units. For the PK substudy: Blood samples will be drawn around the 6th dose\n      (second dose on day 2) at time 0 and then after administration at times 1h, 2h, 4h and 6h\n      (the 6h level will be immediately prior to the next dose). The PK substudy will be conducted\n      with 100 participants in 3 of the 25 participating centers.\n\n      Relevance. In the context of increasing off-label use of vitamin C for sepsis and ongoing\n      trials of vitamin C bundled with other pharmacological interventions, the LOVIT Trial will\n      constitute a rigorous assessment of the effect of vitamin C monotherapy on patient-important\n      outcomes."}, "overall_status": "Recruiting", "start_date": {"@type": "Actual", "#text": "November 8, 2018"}, "completion_date": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "December 31, 2022"}, "primary_completion_date": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "December 31, 2021"}, "phase": "Phase 3", "study_type": "Interventional", "has_expanded_access": "No", "study_design_info": {"allocation": "Randomized", "intervention_model": "Parallel Assignment", "primary_purpose": "Treatment", "masking": "Quadruple (Participant, Care Provider, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)"}, "primary_outcome": {"measure": "Number of deceased participants or with persistent organ dysfunction", "time_frame": "Both assessed at 28 days", "description": "Defined as death or dependency on mechanical ventilation, renal replacement, or vasopressors"}, "secondary_outcome": [{"measure": "Number of participants with persistent organ dysfunction-free days in intensive care unit", "time_frame": "Up to day 28", "description": "Persistent organ dysfunction-free days in intensive care unit"}, {"measure": "Number of participants deceased at 6 months", "time_frame": "6 months", "description": "Mortality at 6 months"}, {"measure": "Score of health related quality of life in 6-month survivors", "time_frame": "6 months", "description": "Assessed by the questionnaire EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D-5L).

Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.\nThe EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' and 'The worst health you can imagine'."}, {"measure": "Global tissue dysoxia", "time_frame": "Days 1, 3, 7", "description": "Assessed by serum lactate concentration"}, {"measure": "Organ function (including renal function)", "time_frame": "Days 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 14, 28", "description": "Assessed by the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score.
