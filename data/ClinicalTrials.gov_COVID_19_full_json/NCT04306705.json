            "textblock": "Tocilizumab doesn't directly kill the novel coronavirus. It's known as an inhibitor of the\n      receptor of interleukin 6 (IL-6), a pro-inflammatory cytokine. In the disease COVID-19, the\n      body may respond to the pathogen by overproducing immune cells and their signaling molecules\n      in a dangerous phenomenon called cytokine release storm.It has been recently speculated that\n      IL-6 as a main culprit in that immune over activation among COVID-19 patients, hence the\n      Tocilizumab clinical trial was initiated. In 2017, the FDA also approved Tocilizumab to treat\n      cytokine release syndrome (CRS), a form of cytokine storm caused by CAR-T treatment. The\n      investigator's hypothesis was that Tocilizumab would be associated with better clinical\n      outcomes, such as decreased systemic inflammation, improved survival rate, better hemodynamic\n      and improved of respiratory distress.Systemic inflammatory response syndrome was one of the\n      main indications for treatment with CRRT. So it is clinically significant to compare the\n      efficacy and safety of Tocilizumab and CRRT in management of CRS triggered by COVID-19."
