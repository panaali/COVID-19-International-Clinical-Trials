If participant consents, they will be randomized 1:1 to treatment with either\n      tradipitant 85 mg PO BID or placebo in addition to standard of care for COVID-19 infection as\n      per the protocol at the treating hospital. NEWS 2 will be assessed at screening and daily\n      following randomization. Inflammatory lab markers as detailed should be collected once per\n      day in the morning, preferably at the same time every morning. All enrolled participants will\n      have whole blood collected for whole genome sequencing."
