At present,\n      there are no proven interventions to prevent progression of the disease. Some preliminary\n      data on SARS pneumonia suggest that inhaled Nitric Oxide (NO) could have beneficial effects\n      on SARS-CoV-2 due to the genomic similarities between this two coronaviruses. In this study\n      we will test whether inhaled NO therapy prevents progression in patients with mild to\n      moderate COVID-19 disease."}, "detailed_description": {"textblock": "To date, no targeted therapeutic treatments for the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak have been\n      identified. Antiviral combined with adjuvant therapies are currently under investigation. The\n      clinical spectrum of the infection is wide, ranging from mild signs of upper respiratory\n      tract infection to severe pneumonia and death.\n\n      In the patients who progress, the time period from symptoms onset to development of dyspnea\n      is reported to be between 5 to 10 days, and that one to severe respiratory distress syndrome\n      from 10 to 14 days. Globally, 15 to 18% of patients deteriorates to the need of mechanical\n      ventilation, despite the use of non-invasive ventilatory support in the earliest phases of\n      the disease. Probability of progression to end stage disease is unpredictable, with the\n      majority of these patients dying from multi-organ failure. Preventing progression in\n      spontaneously breathing patients with mild to moderate disease would translate in improved\n      morbidity and mortality and in a lower use of limited healthcare resources.\n\n      In 2004, during the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak, a pilot study showed that low dose\n      ( max 30 ppm) inhaled NO for 3 days was able to shorten the time of ventilatory support. At\n      the same time, NO donor compound S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine increased survival rate in\n      an in-vitro model of SARS-CoV infected epithelial cells.Based on the genetic similarities\n      between the two viruses, similar effects of NO on SARS-CoV-2 can be hypothesized. While\n      further in-vitro testing is recommended, we proposed a randomized clinical trial to test the\n      effectiveness of inhaled NO in preventing the progression of SARS-CoV-2 related disease, when\n      administered at an early stage."}, "overall_status": "Recruiting", "start_date": {"@type": "Actual", "#text": "March 21, 2020"}, "completion_date": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "April 1, 2022"}, "primary_completion_date": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "April 1, 2021"}, "phase": "Phase 2", "study_type": "Interventional", "has_expanded_access": "No", "study_design_info": {"allocation": "Randomized", "intervention_model": "Parallel Assignment", "primary_purpose": "Treatment", "masking": "None (Open Label)"}, "primary_outcome": {"measure": "Reduction in the incidence of patients with mild/moderate COVID-19 requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation", "time_frame": "28 days", "description": "The primary outcome will be the reduction in the incidence of patients requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation, as a marker of deterioration from a mild to a severe form of COVID-19.
