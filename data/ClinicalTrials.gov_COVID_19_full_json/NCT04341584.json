Anakinra (ANA) is a recombinant human decoy IL-1Ra and\n      therefore blocks IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2. The study has a cohort multiple Randomized Controlled\n      Trials (cmRCT) design. Randomization will occur prior to offering Anakinra administration to\n      patients enrolled in the COVIMUNO-19 cohort. Anakinra will be administered to consenting\n      adult patients hospitalized with CORVID-19 either diagnosed with moderate or severe pneumonia\n      requiring no mechanical ventilation or critical pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation.\n      Patients who will chose not to receive Anakinra will receive standard of cares. Outcomes of\n      Anakinra -treated patients will be compared with outcomes of standard of care treated\n      patients as well as outcomes of patients treated with other immune modulators."
