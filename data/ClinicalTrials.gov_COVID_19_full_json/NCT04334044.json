The virus is now known as SARS-CoV2 calling\n      its disease coronavirus-19 or COVID-19. The mortality of the virus has been reported around\n      2-10% and its causes because of the proinflammatory immune response generated on the host.\n      The cytokines involved in the immune response to COVID-19 are IL-1, IL-2, IL4, IL-6, IL-10,\n      IL-12, IL-13, IL-17, GCSF, MCSF, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1\u03b1, HGF, IFN-\u03b3 y TNF-\u03b1.\n\n      Ruxolitinib is an inhibitor of JAK 1/2 which is responsable for multiple cellular signals\n      including the proinflammatory IL-6. Ruxolitinib works as and immunomodulator decreasing the\n      cytotoxic T lymphocytes and increasing the Treg cells.\n\n      This study is intended to stop the disregulated immune response caused by COVID-19 that\n      generates the pneumonia and subsequent severe acute respiratory syndrome."}, "overall_status": "Not yet recruiting", "start_date": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "April 1, 2020"}, "completion_date": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "June 1, 2020"}, "primary_completion_date": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "June 1, 2020"}, "phase": "Phase 1/Phase 2", "study_type": "Interventional", "has_expanded_access": "No", "study_design_info": {"intervention_model": "Single Group Assignment", "intervention_model_description": "Use of ruxolitinib on patients with respiratory distress and pneumonia changes on chest computed tomography", "primary_purpose": "Treatment", "masking": "None (Open Label)"}, "primary_outcome": {"measure": "Recovery of Pneumonia", "time_frame": "14 days", "description": "Presence of recovery of pneumonia characterized by cease of respiratory symptoms"}, "secondary_outcome": [{"measure": "Response of C-reactive protein", "time_frame": "14 days", "description": "Increment or decrease in mg/ml of C-reactive protein"}, {"measure": "Response of Ferritin", "time_frame": "14 days", "description": "Increment or decrease in ng/ml of ferritin"}, {"measure": "Response of D-dimer", "time_frame": "14 days", "description": "Increment or decrease in mg/ml of D-dimer"}, {"measure": "Rate of ICU admission", "time_frame": "14 days", "description": "Requirement of Intensive Care Unit on the patients under treatment"}, {"measure": "Rate of mechanical ventilation", "time_frame": "14 days", "description": "Requirement of mechanical ventilation on the patients under treatment"}, {"measure": "Overall Survival", "time_frame": "1 month", "description": "Time since the diagnosis to the last follow up (recovery or death)"}, {"measure": "Toxicity Rate", "time_frame": "1 month", "description": "Rate of adverse events associated with ruxolitinib"}], "number_of_arms": "1", "enrollment": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "20"}, "condition": ["COVID-19", "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2"], "arm_group": {"arm_group_label": "Ruxolitinib", "arm_group_type": "Experimental", "description": "Ruxolitinib 10 mg BID since the beginning of dyspnea or increment of work of breathing with pneumonia changes in chest CT-scan"}, "intervention": {"intervention_type": "Drug", "intervention_name": "Ruxolitinib Oral Tablet", "description": "Ruxolitinib 10 mg twice a day", "arm_group_label": "Ruxolitinib"}, "eligibility": {"criteria": {"textblock": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Patients with diagnosed COVID-19 with confirmatory test\n\n          -  Increase in work of breathing or presence of dyspnea\n\n          -  Presence of lung changes associated with COVID pneumonia by chest imaging\n\n          -  Informed consent\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Pregnancy or breastfeeding\n\n          -  Thrombocytopenia below 20,000 cells/mm3\n\n          -  Neutropenia below 500 cels/mm3\n\n          -  Known and active infection of HIV, Hepatitis C, Hepatitis B, Herpes Zoster or\n             Mycobacterium Tuberculosis"}, "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "No"}, "location": {"facility": {"name": "Grupo Cooperativo de Hemopat\u00edas Malignas", "address": {"city": "Huixquilucan", "state": "Estado De M\u00e9xico", "zip": "52763", "country": "Mexico"}}}, "location_countries": {"country": "Mexico"}, "verification_date": "April 2020", "study_first_submitted": "April 1, 2020", "study_first_submitted_qc": "April 2, 2020", "study_first_posted": {"@type": "Actual", "#text": "April 3, 2020"}, "last_update_submitted": "April 2, 2020", "last_update_submitted_qc": "April 2, 2020", "last_update_posted": {"@type": "Actual", "#text": "April 3, 2020"}, "responsible_party": {"responsible_party_type": "Sponsor"}, "condition_browse": {"mesh_term": ["Coronavirus Infections", "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome", "Syndrome"]}, "patient_data": {"sharing_ipd": "No"}}}
