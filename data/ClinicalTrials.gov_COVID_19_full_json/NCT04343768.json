Based on possible therapeutic effects, We decided to lead An Investigation\n      into Beneficial Effects of Interferon Beta 1a, Compared to Interferon Beta 1b And The Base\n      Therapeutic Regiment in Moderate to Severe COVID-19. In a 2003 study, SARS was treated with\n      different human interferons and found that IFN-\u03b2 was 5 to 10 times more effective than other\n      types of interferons and the strongest antiviral drug possible against SARS-CoV.\n\n      The present study is a randomized clinical trial, with the approval of the ethics committee\n      will be conducted on patients who have a positive test confirming COVID-19 in Loghman Hakim\n      Medical Education Center in Tehran.\n\n      *Inclusion Criteria: Age \u2265 18 COVID-19 Confirmed Cases (Either RT-PCR or CT Scan Confirmed)\n      Tympanic Temperature of \u226537.5 AND at least one of the following: Cough, Sputum production,\n      nasal discharge, myalgia, headache or fatigue) on admission.\n\n      Time of onset of the symptoms should be acute ( Days \u2264 10) NEWS2 \u2265 1 on admission (National\n      Early Warning Score 2)\n\n      *Exclusion Criteria: Refusal to participate expressed by patient or legally authorized\n      representative if they are present Patients with prolonged QT or PR intervals, Second or\n      Third Degree heart block, Arrhythmias including torsade de pointes Patients using drugs with\n      potential interaction with Hydroxychloroquine + Lopinavir/Ritonavir, Interferon-\u03b2 1a\u060c\n      Interferon-\u03b2 1b.\n\n      Pregnant or lactating women. History of alcohol or drug addiction in the past 5 years.
