By intensively following participants over a six-month\n      period and collecting serial biospecimens (nasopharyngeal/throat swabs, blood, and saliva)\n      and questionnaire data at nine time points, investigators can uniquely characterize Severe\n      Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission and risk factors for\n      Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) among health care workers and their families"

In participants who test negative\n      for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, nasopharyngeal/throat swabs, saliva, and blood collection will be\n      collected every two weeks for two months, after which monthly samples will be collected for\n      four additional months (9 visits total, including baseline). Weekly questionnaire data and\n      daily temperature data will be collected from each participant for the first two months of\n      the study. Participants with positive nasopharyngeal/throat swabs or saliva will be\n      immediately referred for medical care or home isolation as medically appropriate.\n      Investigators will calculate and compare incidence rates and risk factors of SARS-CoV-2\n      positivity and COVID-19 in healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers and assess symptoms,\n      severity of disease, and rates and direction of household transmission."
