Firstly, investigators will be registered in an\n      online secure registry. After that, a protocol will be developed in order to collect clinical\n      data for the research. It will also include I on the care organization or the perception of\n      the patient and their family members.\n\n      The final stage will consist on retrospective data collection from patients. So, it is a\n      retrospective study data collection, preceded by prospective data registry."
