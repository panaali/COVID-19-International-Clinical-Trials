            "textblock": "The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a substantial strain on the healthcare system, with at least\n      14% of infected patients requiring hospitalization. Identifying ways to ameliorate the\n      progression and severity of the COVID-19 infection and preventing hospitalization is\n      critical.\n\n      Patients suffering from COVID-19 have been shown to have a significant inflammatory response\n      resembling that of cytokine release syndrome, and it is this inflammatory phase that is\n      thought to drive fatality. IL-6 has been shown to be one of the most commonly elevated\n      inflammatory markers in COVID-19 patients, and Tocilizumad, an IL-6 inhibitor, has been used\n      to ameliorate this exaggerated inflammatory response in COVID-19 patients. However, this is\n      used mainly in already hospitalized patients who show signs of increased inflammation, and\n      more research is needed on interventions that slow the onset of inflammation and decrease\n      subsequent hospitalization of infected individuals.\n\n      Resistant potato starch (RPS) has been shown to decrease IL-6 in humans, partly through its\n      ability to increase butyrate levels. Butyrate not only reduces IL-6 production and overall\n      inflammation, but also has been shown to specifically decrease lung inflammation in animal\n      models through cytokine suppression. Further, it may reduce ACE2 receptor expression, which\n      is the main entry mechanism for COVID-19 into epithelial lung cells. Increased butyrate in\n      the intestinal microbiome is also associated with less viral lower respiratory tract\n      infections in allo- HCT recipients. Our preliminary data shows an increase in butyrate levels\n      in participants' stool within one week of RPS therapy (20 grams twice daily) with no\n      noticeable side effect.\n\n      To this end, we have designed a multicenter randomized clinical trial to determine the\n      efficacy of resistant potato starch in reducing the need for hospitalization for COVID-19\n      positive patients. We will enroll 1300 unhospitalized COVID-19 positive individuals who are\n      being monitored in the outpatient setting. Patients will be randomized to either receive RPS\n      therapy (2 tablespoons (~ 20 grams) of RPS twice daily) or a placebo (2 tablespoons of\n      non-resistant, digestible starch twice daily) , each for 14 days. Our primary outcome is the\n      rate of hospitalization for COVID-19 related complications. Secondary outcomes will look at\n      time to recovery and symptom severity scores."
