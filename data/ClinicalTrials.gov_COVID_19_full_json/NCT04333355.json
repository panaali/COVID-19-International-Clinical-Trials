One of these alternatives is the use\n      of convalescent plasma. The investigator will use plasma obtained from convalescent\n      individuals with proven novel SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, diagnosed with\n      coronavirus-19-induced disease and symptom-free for a period of not less than 10 days since\n      they recovered from the disease. This plasma will be infused in patients affected by the same\n      virus, but who have developed respiratory complications that have not responded favorably to\n      usual treatment such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and other antivirals.\n      The investigator will evaluate the safety of this procedure by accounting for any adverse\n      event."

Plasma will be fractioned in 250ml.\n      Infusion will start after a clinical evaluation and blood sampling. Patients will remain\n      under careful observation. If no adverse event is present, infusion will be repeated after 24\n      hours and the investigator will evaluate patients again 48 hours after the second\n      transfusion. A final evaluation will be performed at day 14. The investigator will evaluate\n      the safety of this procedure by accounting for any adverse event."
