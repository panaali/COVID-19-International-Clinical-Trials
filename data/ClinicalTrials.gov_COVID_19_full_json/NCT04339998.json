The investigators will prospectively evaluate and analyze changes in the appearance of\n           the lungs and heart through serial acquisition of focused point-of-care ultrasound\n           images in a cohort of patients with or under investigation for COVID-19.\n\n        2. The investigators will correlate changes noted in ultrasound with clinical course and\n           diagnostic evaluation to ascertain whether changes on ultrasound could improve care\n           through earlier diagnosis or identification of patients at high risk of disease\n           progression."

At UMMC, a tertiary care center, clinicians will recruit and evaluate\n      patients with or under investigation for COVID-19. At Bethesda clinicians will recruit and\n      evaluate patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 as demonstrated by a positive\n      PT-PCR.\n\n      POCUS exams will be performed in a cohort of 200-500 patients with or under investigation for\n      COVID-19. Serial ultrasound examinations will be performed every 48-72 hours until discharge,\n      death, or study completion. Participants will undergo POCUS at enrollment by their treating\n      physicians. Inquiry into study enrollment will be performed over the phone rather than in\n      person, given the current scarcity of PPE and the added use that would occur with in-person\n      enrollment."
