The current strategy uses a public health model of identifying\n      infected cases, isolation, and quarantine to stop transmission. Once exposed, observation is\n      standard-of-care. Therapy to outpatients is generally not given.\n\n      No effective therapy currently exists for treatment. The lack of effective therapy diminishes\n      persons presenting post-exposure for self-quarantine. Having an effective post-exposure\n      prophylaxis, even if only partially effective, may additionally create synergy for the public\n      health strategy of case identification and isolation - if a safe prophylaxis is available.\n      People who develop COVID-19 disease generally develop signs and symptoms, including mild\n      respiratory symptoms and fever, after an average of 5-6 days after exposure (i.e. mean\n      incubation period). The range of the incubation period is between 1 to 14 days.\n\n      Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus have mild disease and recover. Approximately 80%\n      of laboratory-confirmed patients have had mild to moderate disease, which includes\n      non-pneumonia and pneumonia cases, 14% have severe disease, and 6% are critically ill with\n      respiratory failure, shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction.\n\n      Chloroquine or Hydroxychloroquine may have antiviral effects against SARS-COV2 which may\n      prevent COVID19 disease or early preemptive therapy may ameliorate disease severity. This\n      trial will use a modification of standard malaria dosing of hydroxychloroquine to provide\n      post-exposure prophylaxis / preemptive therapy.\n\n      The trial is open to enrollment of healthcare workers or household contacts nationwide from\n      across the United States. One must have a known diagnosis or exposure to a known cases. Both\n      asymptomatic persons with exposure within 4 days as well as symptomatic persons with\n      confirmed COVID19 disease within 4 days of symptom onset can consent to participate.\n\n      For information on how to participate in the research trial, please email covid19@umn.edu for\n      instructions.
