            "textblock": "Severe cases of COVID-19 often mimic the typical course of Adult Respiratory Distress\n      Syndrome (ARDS) and its predictable sequelae. These patients often require intubation and\n      ventilator support in order to sustain adequate oxygenation. Once a COVID-19 patient is\n      intubated, Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) is a mainstay of treatment and is used in\n      order to improve lung function, treat underlying atelectasis, improve oxygenation, and\n      improve survival. In fact, early clinical data as well as reports from front line physicians\n      treating COVID-19 suggest that PEEP has been the most effective treatment modality. In many\n      cases, PEEP has resulted in improved oxygenation and improved survival.\n\n      PEEP decreases the propensity for the alveoli to collapse by increasing the air pressure in\n      the lungs. This residual pressure in the lungs at the end of exhalation decreases shunting\n      and allows for more complete gas exchange and improved oxygenation. In patients, PEEP is one\n      of the safest ways to increase PaO2 and is used on almost all modern ventilator settings.\n\n      The GO2 PEEP MOUTHPIECE is a simple, comfortable, and straightforward mouthpiece with a\n      bidirectional valve that effectively delivers PEEP with every breath. Early application of\n      the GO2 PEEP MOUTHPIECE in non-intubated COVID-19 patients may improve outcomes and save\n      lives. Furthermore, this device may allow for less strain on limited resources, especially\n      ventilators. This PEEP mouthpiece could be employed under an oxygen non-rebreather mask to\n      improve oxygenation and avoid intubation."
