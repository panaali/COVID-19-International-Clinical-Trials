This disease has gain the\n      attention of all nations after it has been stated as a pandemic by the World Health\n      Organization (WHO) in March 12, 2020. Currently no treatment has been proved to be efficient\n      in the treatment of infected patients by COVID-19. Natural honey has been demonstrated as\n      potent antimicrobial in many research investigations and has been considered a good\n      alternative for antiviral drugs for the treatment of some viral infections. The investigators\n      aim to study the efficacy of natural honey in the treatment of COVID-19 patients in this\n      randomized , multicenter, controlled trial, comparing honey in one arm to standard care in\n      the other arm."

            "textblock": "The (SARS CoV-2) virus is spreading globally, threatening all healthcare systems. Many\n      healthcare systems and organizations are using different protocols and measures to fight the\n      COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir and other antiviral medications are currently under\n      research investigations. Natural honey has been well known for its high health properties in\n      diabetes, nutrition, dyslipidemia, skin lesions and it got FDA approval for topical wound\n      treatment in 2007 as the most potent antimicrobial agent. Honey has been previously\n      considered as an alternative for acyclovir in the treatment of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1)\n      and it also demonstrated for its significant antiviral effect against varicella zoster virus\n      (VZV). Many studies have demonstrated the broad spectrum antimicrobial effect of honey as an\n      antibacterial, anti fungal, antiviral and antimycobacterial. The National Institute for\n      Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the Public Health England (PHE) guidelines recommended\n      honey as a first line of treatment for acute cough caused by upper respiratory tract\n      infection which is currently a cornerstone symptom in COVID-19 infectious disease. Moreover,\n      natural honey should no longer be used as \"alternative\" and deserves to gain more attention\n      by scientists and researchers. The aim of this trial is to study the efficacy of natural\n      honey in treatment of patients infected with COVID-19 in comparison with current standard\n      care.\n\n      Methods:\n\n      This will be a randomized , multi center, double armed clinical trial, patients will be\n      randomly assigned to two groups on 1:1 basis. Natural honey group will include patients\n      receiving standard care and added intervention in the form of natural honey in a dose of\n      1gm/kg/day (previously used safely in small studies) divided into 2 to 3 doses for continuous\n      14 days. The other arm is the arm receiving the standard care according to the center\n      protocol.\n\n      Our primary outcome is days for recovery using the parameters: turning from positive to\n      negative swaps, days from fever to no fever and lung inflammation recovery in x ray or CT,\n      our secondary outcome is the 30 days mortality rate. Data will be collected and statistically\n      managed using STATA blindly from who received the intervention."
