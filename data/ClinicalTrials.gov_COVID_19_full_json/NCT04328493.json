There is currently no vaccine to prevent COVID-19 or\n      therapeutic agent to treat COVID-19. This clinical trial is designed to evaluate potential\n      therapeutics for the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19.\n\n      We hypothesis that chloroquine slows viral replication in patients with COVID-19, attenuating\n      the infection, and resulting in more rapid declines in viral load in throat swabs. This viral\n      attenuation should be associated with improved patient outcomes. Given the enormous\n      experience of its use in malaria chemoprophylaxis, excellent safety and tolerability profile,\n      and its very low cost, if proved effective then chloroquine would be a readily deployable and\n      affordable treatment for patients with COVID-19.\n\n      The study is funded and leaded by The Ministry of Health, Vietnam."

All these\n      patients will be subject to the same entry and exclusion criteria for the randomized trial,\n      and undergo the same procedures. They will all receive chloroquine at the doses used in the\n      trial (see sections below); they will not be randomized. The purpose of the pilot is to\n      develop the study procedures for the randomized controlled trial, including the safe\n      monitoring of patients, to refine the CRF, and to acquire some preliminary data on the safety\n      of chloroquine in those with COVID-19.\n\n      Once the pilot study has been completed, and the data reviewed by the TSC and DMC, and the\n      MOH ethics committee, we will then proceed to the trial. We will aim for minimum delay\n      between completing the pilot study and starting the randomized trial.\n\n      The main study is an open label, randomised, controlled trial that will be conducted in 240\n      in-patients in Ho Chi Minh City. Viet Nam.\n\n      Patients will have daily assessment as per standard of care while in-patients by the hospital\n      staff. While in-patients the study will collect the following data: peripheral oxygen\n      saturation (pulse oximeter), respiratory rate, and FiO2 6 hourly. The use of ventilator or\n      other assisted breathing device will be recorded each day.\n\n      Patients will have more detailed clinical assessment recorded once weekly (i.e. on study\n      days, 7, 14, 21 and 28 (\u00b12 days) and on the day of discharge. This will include symptoms,\n      respiratory, and cardiovascular examination, blood investigations and microbiological\n      investigations as per the study schedule, recording of all medication and review of any\n      adverse events.\n\n      The decision to discharge patients will be at the discretion of the attending physician and\n      depend upon the clinical status of the patient. According to current standard of care\n      recovery and hospital discharge is dependent upon the patient having had 2 daily consecutive\n      negative PCR throat swabs. Following discharge patients will be seen on days 14, 28, 42 and\n      56 post-randomization."
