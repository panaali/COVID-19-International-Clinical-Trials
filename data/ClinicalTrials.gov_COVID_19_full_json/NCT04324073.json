Sarilumab is a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds\n      specifically to both soluble and membrane-bound IL-6Rs (sIL-6R\u03b1 and mIL-6R\u03b1) and has been\n      shown to inhibit IL-6-mediated signaling through these receptors. The study has a cohort\n      multiple Randomized Controlled Trials (cmRCT) design. Randomization will occur prior to\n      offering Sarilumab administration to patients enrolled in the CORIMUNO-19 cohort. Sarilumab\n      will be administered to consenting adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 either diagnosed\n      with moderate or severe pneumonia requiring no mechanical ventilation or critical pneumonia\n      requiring mechanical ventilation. Patients who will chose not to receive Sarilumab will\n      receive standard of care. Outcomes of Sarilumab-treated patients will be compared with\n      outcomes of standard of care-treated patients as well as with outcomes of patients treated\n      with other immune modulators."
