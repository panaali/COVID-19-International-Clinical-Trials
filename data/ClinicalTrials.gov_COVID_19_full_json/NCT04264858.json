The pathogen is a previously\n      unknown new coronavirus, namely 2019 new coronavirus (2019 novel coronavirus, 2019 nCoV).\n      However, there is no specific anti-viral drug. It has been found that the specific antibodies\n      against virus antigen are produced after these patients were cured, which could block the\n      infection of 2019 nCoV on the host cells. At present, immunoadsorption is the most direct,\n      rapid and effective method to separate immunoglobulin from the cured patients. Therefore, the\n      study aims to prepare the immunoglobulin from 2019-ncov pneumonia cured patients, evaluate\n      the efficacy and safety of the immunoglobulin in 2019-ncov pneumonia cured patients on the\n      treatment of acute severe 2019-ncov pneumonia, and provide a new strategy for the treatment\n      of 2019-ncov pneumonia."}, "overall_status": "Not yet recruiting", "start_date": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "March 17, 2020"}, "completion_date": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "May 31, 2020"}, "primary_completion_date": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "April 30, 2020"}, "phase": "N/A", "study_type": "Interventional", "has_expanded_access": "No", "study_design_info": {"allocation": "Non-Randomized", "intervention_model": "Parallel Assignment", "primary_purpose": "Treatment", "masking": "None (Open Label)"}, "primary_outcome": {"measure": "Time to Clinical Improvement (TTCI)", "time_frame": "up to 28 days", "description": "TTCI is defined as the time (in days) from initiation of study treatment (active or placebo) until a decline of two categories from admission status on a six-category ordinal scale of clinical status which ranges from 1 (discharged) to 6 (death).\nSix-category ordinal scale: 6.
