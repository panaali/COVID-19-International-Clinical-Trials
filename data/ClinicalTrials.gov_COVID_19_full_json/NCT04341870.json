Sarilumab is a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to both\n      soluble and membrane-bound IL-6Rs (sIL-6R\u03b1 and mIL-6R\u03b1) and has been shown to inhibit\n      IL-6-mediated signaling through these receptors. The study has a cohort multiple Randomized\n      Controlled Trials (cmRCT) design. Randomization will occur prior to offering investigational\n      treatments administration to patients enrolled in the CORIMUNO-19 cohort (NCT04324047).\n      Sarilumab+Azithromycin+Hydroxychloroquine, or Sarilumab only will be administered to\n      consenting adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 either diagnosed with moderate or severe\n      pneumonia requiring no mechanical ventilation. All patients will receive standard of care\n      along with randomized investigational treatments. Outcomes of included patients will be\n      compared between groups as well as with outcomes of patients in the CORIMUNO-19 cohort\n      treated with other immune modulators or standard of care."
