No clinical procedures are required by this observational protocol. Data on\n           the procedures already performed during the routine diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19\n           patients will be collected. The list of clinical and laboratory parameters is provided\n           to direct data collection for this observational study (as available in the medical\n           records).\n\n      During their hospitalization, patients will be monitored as per standard hospital practice or\n      as per national (emergency) guidelines in accordance with extraordinary circumstances\n      relating to the COVID-19 outbreak. After discharge, patients will be asked to provide (from\n      their primary health care providers) relevant laboratory results for 30 days following start\n      of COVID-19 treatment via ventilation (either mechanical or non-invasive)."
