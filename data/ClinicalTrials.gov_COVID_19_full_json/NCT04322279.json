            "textblock": "In December 2019, a pneumonia due to a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in the city of\n      Wuhan, in China. In a few weeks, the number of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection has\n      dramatically increased, with almost 150'000 cases and more than 6'000 reported deaths on\n      March, 16th 2020.\n\n      Little is known on the rate of human-to-human transmission of this new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2\n      in the community and within the hospital.\n\n      Depending on the country, contact subjects considered to be at high or moderate risk of\n      SARS-CoV-2 are, either isolated at home for a period of time defined by the health\n      authorities or, on the contrary, continue their professional activity on the condition that\n      they adopt measures to prevent transmission to those around them. In most European countries,\n      healthcare workers adopt this second option. In all cases, it is most often recommended that\n      contact persons monitor their state of health and communicate it to the persons dedicated to\n      this action.\n\n      Whether such subjects become spreaders of the virus is not known, nor is the proportion of\n      viral spreader who will develop a symptomatic infection.\n\n      In this study, we aim to evaluate the virological and clinical outcomes of subjects following\n      a contact at high/moderate risk of SARS-CoV-2 acquisition, in community-subjects and/or\n      healthcare workers.\n\n      The study population is represented by all subjects who had a contact with\n      laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases and whose contact was considered to be at high/moderate\n      risk of SARS-CoV-2 acquisition.\n\n      This include both children and adult subjects, subject without social security, and\n      healthcare workers.\n\n      Procedures added by the research:\n\n      Blood sampling for determination of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 type M immunoglobulins or type\n      G immunoglobulins by microneutralisation technique.\n\n      Blood sampling for whole exome sequencing"
