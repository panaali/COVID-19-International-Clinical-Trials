            "textblock": "Pakistan is a resource restraint country, it's not possible to carry out coronavirus testing\n      at mass scale. Owing to the aerosol producing nature of the dental profession, carrying out\n      dental work on asymptomatic patients carrying coronavirus puts the entire dental team at a\n      great risk of not only acquiring the infection but also transmitting it to the others.\n\n      Identifying an antiviral gargle that could substantially reduce the colonies of COVID-19\n      residing in mouth and oro-pharynx is likely to reduce the viral load. This topical therapy is\n      speculated to substantially reduce the transmission of infection in micro-aerosol generated\n      in the dental practice. Such topical anti-viral therapy could also help to improve the\n      overall symptoms of the patient."

Patients will be inducted from the pool of known patients (laboratory confirmed\n      COVID-19 participants) already admitted at AKUH. Molecular and immunological testing will be\n      done at the Juma laboratory of AKUH. The intervention drugs (Povidone-Iodine, Hydogen\n      Peroxide and Normal Saline will be obtained from the AKUH distribution department and/ or\n      AKUH pharmacy. The Neem extract will be compounded at the Chemistry department, University of\n      Karachi/ HEJ institute of Organic Chemistry, University of Karachi.\n\n      It will be a pilot study, so will need just 20 patients. There will be four groups. Group A\n      (n=5) patients on 10 ml gargle of 0.2% Povidone-Iodine for 20-30 seconds, twice daily for 5\n      days. Group B (n=5) patients will be subjected to 10 ml gargle of 1% Hydrogen peroxide for\n      20-30 seconds, twice daily for 5 days. Group C will comprise of (n=5) subjects on 10ml gargle\n      of Neem extract based mouth rinse for 20-30 seconds, twice daily for 5 days. Group D (n=5)\n      patient will use normal saline gargle for a similar time period.\n\n      Data collection: The baseline oral swab will be taken from the tonsillar pillars on day one\n      before initiating the gargles by trained dentist. The end-point oral swab will be taken on\n      day 5, just after using the prescribed gargle. Patient will be provided a hood so that they\n      themselves don't generate aerosol in the immediate vicinity while carrying out the gargling.\n\n      Repeated measures ANOVA will be used to compare the reduction in intra-oral viral loads and\n      the change in inflammatory biomarkers in the four study groups. A p-value of <0.05 will be\n      taken as statistically significant."
