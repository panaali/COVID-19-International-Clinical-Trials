The child appears little or\n      no affected by this infection. It is estimated that the child could be asymptomatic or\n      pauci-symptomatic carrier and thus be vector of the disease. For this reason, measures have\n      been taken to close schools and contain populations in a large number of countries, including\n      France. However, there are no data on the prevalence of COVID-19 in children."
