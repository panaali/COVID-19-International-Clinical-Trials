Subjects with high SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody\n      titers who meet standard blood bank criteria for plasma donation will then be scheduled for\n      plasma collection sessions. Following testing of the collected plasma for potential\n      pathogens, this plasma may be used and/or converted into an intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)\n      preparation for further study."

Any sign of active illness of any kind including COVID-19 illness (as judged by the\n             investigator), including but not limited to:\n\n               -  Subjective or documented fever (\u226538\u00b0C)\n\n               -  Dry cough\n\n               -  Shortness of breath\n\n          2. Participation in medical research that includes:\n\n               -  Protocols that are currently ongoing or will start during the duration of this\n                  study that require more than 100 mL of blood to be given in any 8-week period of\n                  time\n\n               -  Administration of any unlicensed drug within the last 3 months or during the\n                  duration of this study\n\n               -  Administration of any unlicensed vaccine within the last 12 months or during the\n                  duration of this study.\n\n          3. Subjects that have participated in previous plasma collection or other cell component\n             collection procedures within the last 3 months may have restrictions to participation\n             based on the site plasma collection SOP. In this scenario, discussion should occur\n             with the blood establishment to ensure eligibility to donate plasma."
