            "textblock": "Some studies have shown that the main pathogenesis of patients with covid19 is related to\n      ACE2 receptor. Lung is one of the main organs, and there are many ACE2 receptors in\n      cardiovascular system. ACEI / ARB is the main target of antihypertensive drugs. Previous\n      reports suggested that there were large number of patients with covid19 also suffered from\n      hypertension, suggesting that patients with hypertension may be the susceptible to covid19.\n      Therefore, we try to follow up the patients admitted to Hankou hospital to explore the impact\n      of hypertension and hypertension treatment on the severity and prognosis of patients with\n      covid19, so as to provide new methods for the treatment of patients with covid19 in the\n      future."

            "textblock": "In December, 2019, a cluster of severe pneumonia cases of unknown cause emerged in Wuhan,\n      China, with clinical presentations greatly resembling viral pneumonia1. Deep sequencing\n      analysis from lower respiratory tract samples indicated a novel coronavirus, which was named\n      2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, then named COVID-19). Up to Mar 16, 2020, the total number\n      of patients had risen sharply to 153,546 confirmed cases worldwide\n      (http://2019ncov.chinacdc.cn/2019-nCoV/global.html). The data extracted from 1099 patients\n      with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in China from January 29, 2020 showed that hypertension is\n      the most common coexisting illness of COVID-19 patients, ranging from 13.4% in nonsevere\n      patient vs. 23.4% in severe patients, and the total incidence is as high as 15%2.\n      Interestingly, ACE2 is involved in the pathogenesis of both hypertension and SARS-COV-2\n      pneumonia. The above reasons prompted us to speculate that the organs attacked by SARS-COV-2\n      might not only be lungs, but also include other ACE2 expression organs, especially\n      cardiovascular system. In addition, patients with comorbid hypertension, especially those\n      with long-term oral ACEI/ARB medication for hypertension, might have different susceptibility\n      and severity levels of pneumonia upon SARS-COV-2 attack. Therefore, we investigated and\n      compared the demographic characteristics, coexisting disease, severity of pneumonia, and the\n      effect of antihypertensive drugs (ACEI/ARB versus non-ACEI/ARB) in patients with COVID-19\n      coexisting hypertension, thereby, hopefully, to reduce the mortality and morbidity associated\n      with hypertension in patients with COVID-19."
