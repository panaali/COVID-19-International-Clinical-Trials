Those specimens will only be used after all clinically\n      indicated testing and confirmation procedures have been completed. Assistance from the Public\n      Health Laboratory Service, Department of Health, will be invited to retrieve samples as well\n      as participate in this study.\n\n      Patients hospitalized for pneumonia in medical wards and ICU at the Prince of Wales Hospital\n      tested negative for COVID-19 will be recruited as controls.\n\n      Understanding the clinical, virological, microbiological and immunological profiles of this\n      infection is urgently needed to facilitate its management and control."
