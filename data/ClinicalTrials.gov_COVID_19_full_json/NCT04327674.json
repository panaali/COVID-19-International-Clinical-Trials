Rapid and\n      accurate diagnostic workflow is of paramount importance. Access to radiological diagnostics\n      tools such as x-ray or computed tomography of the chest are limited even in high-resource\n      settings.\n\n      Focused lung ultrasound, FLUS, is a point-of-care diagnostic tool that allows rapid and\n      on-site assessment of lung abnormalities. No transportation of the patient is required thus\n      lowering risk of spreading SAR-CoV- inside the hospital.\n\n      This study aims to explore the diagnostic value of FLUS in the COVID-19 pandemic and to\n      explore if FLUS findings can predict risk of respiratory failure."}, "overall_status": "Recruiting", "start_date": {"@type": "Actual", "#text": "March 14, 2020"}, "completion_date": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "May 15, 2020"}, "primary_completion_date": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "May 15, 2020"}, "study_type": "Observational [Patient Registry]", "has_expanded_access": "No", "study_design_info": {"observational_model": "Cohort", "time_perspective": "Prospective"}, "target_duration": "1 Month", "primary_outcome": {"measure": "FLUS findings and respiratory failure", "time_frame": "Up to 3 months.", "description": "Analysis of FLUS related to risk of development of respiratory failure."}, "secondary_outcome": [{"measure": "FLUS findings and chest x-ray.", "time_frame": "Up to 3 months.", "description": "Analysis of FLUS related to risk of result of chest x-ray"}, {"measure": "FLUS findings and admission to intensive care.", "time_frame": "Up to 3 months.", "description": "Analysis of FLUS related to risk of intensive care admission"}, {"measure": "FLUS findings and SAR-CoV-2 PCR-test result.", "time_frame": "Up to 3 months.", "description": "Analysis of FLUS related to result from SAR-CoV-2 PCR-test"}], "enrollment": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "375"}, "condition": "COVID-19", "eligibility": {"study_pop": {"textblock": "All patients who have symptoms on COVID-19 and is seen at a hospital."}, "sampling_method": "Non-Probability Sample", "criteria": {"textblock": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Clinical suspicion of COVID-19 requiring contact to a hospital.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Age less than 18 years\n\n          -  Previous enrollment in this study."}, "gender": "All", "minimum_age": "18 Years", "maximum_age": "N/A", "healthy_volunteers": "Accepts Healthy Volunteers"}, "overall_official": {"last_name": "S\u00f8ren H Skaarup", "role": "Principal Investigator", "affiliation": "Aarhus Universitets Hospital"}, "overall_contact": {"last_name": "S\u00f8ren H Skaarup", "phone": "28911869", "email": "soeska@rm.dk"}, "location": [{"facility": {"name": "Lungemedicinsk Forskningsafdeling.
