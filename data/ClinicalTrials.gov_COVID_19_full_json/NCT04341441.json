The samples will be collected using\n      standard aseptic procedures and will be stored in a 4\u00b0C refrigerator or cooler until\n      transport to the research laboratory where the samples will be processed. Samples will be\n      processed to serum plasma or cell components. Testing for SARS-CoV 2 will be done for study\n      entry samples. Remainder of the samples will be stored in -80\u00b0C for whole blood/serum plasma\n      and cell samples will be stored in liquid nitrogen for future testing."
