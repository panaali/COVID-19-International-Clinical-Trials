            "textblock": "CROWN CORONATION is a large, Bayesian adaptive, pragmatic, participant-level randomized,\n      multi-center, transdisciplinary, international placebo-controlled trial. It has been designed\n      in accordance with CONSORT guidelines. Randomization will be stratified by age (<50 and \u226550)\n      and study site. Participants will be healthcare workers at risk for contracting SARS-CoV-2.\n      Participants will be randomized into one of four arms:\n\n        -  Low-dose (300mg chloroquine base weekly);\n\n        -  Medium-dose (300mg chloroquine base twice weekly);\n\n        -  High-dose (150 mg chloroquine base daily);\n\n        -  Placebo.\n\n      In all treatment arms, an induction dose of 1200mg chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine base (or\n      equivalent number of placebo tablets in the placebo arm) will be taken in 4 divided daily\n      doses (that is 300mg chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine base per day for four days) before\n      starting the low, medium, or high dose regimen .\n\n      In certain countries (especially where malaria is not endemic), hydroxychloroquine is more\n      readily available and will be used instead of chloroquine. Based on in vitro studies and\n      reviews of drug toxicity , we consider 150mg of hydroxychloroquine base to be equivalent to\n      150mg of chloroquine base in terms of efficacy. New dosage-based arm(s) might be added or\n      removed. The trial will evaluate which of the intervention arms is most effective at\n      decreasing the incidence of severe COVID-19 disease, without unacceptable side effects or\n      safety events.\n\n      Participants will complete weekly (smart phone- based) data logs, and follow- up information\n      will be collected until 2 months after enrolment or death. In addition, where possible, we\n      will use telemedicine approaches to collection information on participants. The study flow\n      overview is outlined in Figure 4. We will provide adherence support interventions that have\n      worked and been tested for Human Immunodeficiency Virus Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (HIV PrEP)\n      (e.g. two-way SMS with check in for those that report symptoms or adverse events). On\n      enrollment, the local trial team will create a new electronic case record from (CRF) on the\n      web-based study database and record basic demographic information. The database will be\n      hosted on UK based servers managed by Net Solving Ltd. Local investigators will have access\n      to the part of the CRF to enable recording of outcome data and/or severity of COVID-19\n      symptoms. Participants will be given a secure login to enable them to complete an initial\n      participant health questionnaire and the daily data logs."
