Participants will be enrolled into one\n      of two components of this study. Based on initial swabs/symptoms, volunteers who are COVID-19\n      negative will be enrolled in the Prevention study and randomized to receive standard\n      institutional precautions or standard institutional precautions + NORS. Those who are\n      COVID-19 positive will be enrolled in the open-label Treatment Sub-Study."

            "textblock": "The novel, human-infecting corona-virus, provisionally named 2019 novel corona virus\n      (2019-nCoV) is a single-strand, positive-sense RNA virus and has a similar receptor-binding\n      domain structure to that of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The virus is transmitted via airborne\n      droplets to the nasal mucosa. Replication occurs locally in the nasal mucosa, in ciliated\n      epithelial cells, over a 3-day incubation period. The mucosal cells are damaged with a\n      resultant inflammatory response similar to the common cold. During this time the virus is\n      shed in nasal secretions causing disease in the lower respiratory tract, potentially causing\n      fatal viral pneumonia.\n\n      The literature supports that NO or its derivatives have inhibitory effects on a variety of\n      viral infections. This inhibitory effect was shown to be marked in Interferon (IFN) mediated\n      inhibition manifested by activated macrophage. It was also shown to be correlated with\n      s-nitrosylation of viral proteins such as reductases and proteases.\n\n      Based on the genetic similarities between SARS and corona viruses, similar viricidal effects\n      of NO on COVID-19 can be hypothesized.\n\n      SaNOtize has developed an innovative approach to provide nitric oxide gas using a formulation\n      called Nitric Oxide Releasing Solution (NORS). This patented solution releases virucidal\n      doses of NO for a sustained period (at least 30 min) against Influenza A.\n\n      NORS delivered as a gargle (AM), nasal spray (PRN) or as a nasopharyngeal flush (PM) has the\n      potential to decontaminate the upper respiratory tract that could preventing transmission and\n      progression of COVID-19 in Healthcare Workers & Individuals at Risk of Infection.\n\n      The randomized Prevention study will investigate the ability of NORS to prevent COVID-19\n      infection when used prophylactically. The open-label Treatment Sub-Study is expected to be\n      small and will provide pilot data on the possibility of NORS as a treatment for Mild/Moderate\n      COVID-19 infection."
