An array of drugs approved for other\n      indications as well as several investigational drugs are being studied in several hundred\n      clinical trials that are underway across the globe; however, currently there are no clinical\n      trials available to patients in Arizona.\n\n      This study will determine if a specific drug cocktail can improve clinical outcomes in\n      patients with confirmed Mild SARS-CoV-2"

Current estimates suggest\n      that the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is both highly contagious (estimated reproductive\n      rate, 2-3) and five to fifty-fold more lethal than seasonal influenza (estimated mortality\n      rate, 0.5-5%); therefore, interventions to decrease the incidence and severity of COVID-19\n      are emergently needed. In Maricopa County there has yet to be a clinical trial to evaluate\n      people who are SARS-CoV-2 positive with mild symptoms. This study will measure the\n      improvement of COVID-19 disease status as measured by time (days) required from initiation of\n      treatment to improvement of clinical status from mild to symptom free on 14 days of a\n      cocktail therapy of Hydroxychloroquine, Indomethacin and Zithromax."
