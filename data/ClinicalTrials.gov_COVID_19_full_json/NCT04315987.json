The novel coronavirus attacks the human body by attaching to the\n      angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), a protective enzyme against lung damage. In addition,\n      the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 for HCoV-19 Spike protein priming is also essential for\n      the host cell entry and spread. Coronaviruses can be deadly, in large part because they cause\n      \"cytokine storms.\" These storms result from imbalances between pro-inflammatory and\n      anti-inflammatory proteins called cytokines, which can cause extreme inflammation and\n      respiratory complications. Respiratory distress kills hundreds of thousands of people each\n      year worldwide, and hundreds of clinical trials are testing drugs to treat it.\n\n      MSCs have been widely used in cell-based therapy, from basic research to clinical trials\n      Safety and effectiveness have been clearly documented in many clinical trials, especially in\n      the immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.\n\n      NestCell\u00ae is a mesenchymal stem cell therapy produced by Cellavita and proved to be safe in\n      previous clinical trials.\n\n      The aim of this study is assess the efficacy of NestCell\u00ae as an add-on therapy to standard\n      treatment to treat patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. All patients will receive 1x10^6\n      cells/kg weight on days 1, 3 and 7.\n\n      The study will be divided in 2 phases.

Thereafter,\n      the Safety Monitoring Board will meet and evaluate all collected safety and efficacy\n      information and decide whether it is safe to continue the treatment and if the next dose\n      should remain the same or if any change in posology or dose should be done.
