            "textblock": "Background Very recent evidences support the hypothesis that the novel coronavirus 2019\n      (2019-nCoV) uses the SARS-1 coronavirus receptor ACE2 for gains entry into target cells.\n      Angiotensin receptor-blocker (ARB) drugs, one of the most commonly used antihypertensive\n      drug, typically increase ACE2 expression, often very markedly. With SARS-CoV-2 infection\n      increased ACE2 expression very definitely would not be beneficial, and could be adverse.\n      However, augmented ACE2 expression with ARBs has been demonstrated in the kidneys and heart\n      but has not been tested in the lungs. So, the hypothesis that using of ARBS or ACE inhibitors\n      (ACE-I) drugs during the COVID-19 may possibly be harmful is urgently to be verified in\n      epidemiological studies.\n\n      Aim To retrospectively test whether 2019-nCoV patients treated with ARB or ACE-I, in\n      comparison with patients who not, are at higher risk of having severe COVID-19 (including\n      death).\n\n      Population Hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection (any type).\n\n      Outcome The project will retrospectively collect data on the most severe manifestation of\n      COVID-19 occurred in 2019-nCoV infected patients during hospitalization. Severity will be\n      classified as: hospital discharge with healing, asymptomatic, mild complications but not\n      pneumonia, not severe pneumonia, severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)\n      and death. Classification of pneumonia will follow WHO criteria. Data on severity will be\n      obtained from medical record at one-point time (at the moment of inclusion in the study).\n\n      Exposure Treatment for ARB or ACE-I. When available, type of drugs will be recorded.\n\n      Study design Patients will be divided in two groups, a) controls: individuals who did not\n      develop severe COVID-19 respiratory disease (including individuals who recovered from the\n      infection) and b) cases: individuals who developed severe COVID-19 disease (including fatal\n      events). Association between use of ACE-I or ARB and severity of COVID-19 will be assessed by\n      using of multivariable logistic regression analysis. Data on potential confounders will be\n      obtained by medical records: age, sex, time intervals from hospital admission to worse\n      manifestation of COVID-19 and to eventual death or recovering, smoking, body mass index,\n      history of myocardial infarction, diabetes, hypertension, cancer, respiratory disease, other\n      morbidities, creatinine, insulin, glomerular filtration rate together with use of\n      Tocilizumab, anti-aldosterone agents, diuretics, Kaletra, cortisone, Remdesevir, Chloroquine,\n      Sacubitril or Valsartan."
