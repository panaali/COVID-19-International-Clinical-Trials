            "textblock": "The severe form of COVID-19 infection is characterized and marked by severe pneumonia and the\n      Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). ARDS is characterized by the loss of pulmonary\n      tissue compliance and severe hypoxia. The central pathophysiologic changes of COVID-19+ ARDS\n      are dysregulated inflammation within the alveolar space and altered permeability of the\n      alveolar-capillary barrier. The public health impact of this COVID-19+ ARDS is considerable\n      with a large number of ARDS cases that need to be treated currently on German Intensive Care\n      Units. To date, the associated mortality ranges between 30 to 50%. In the ongoing COVID-19\n      crisis cases of ARDS will still increase and pose a significant challenge to the German\n      Medical System. Despite the emerging understanding of COVID-19+ ARDS, treatment only remains\n      to be symptomatic using mechanical ventilation, prone positioning and in severe cases of\n      hypoxia extracorporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Current evidence generated by clinical\n      trials demonstrates that patients with ARDS should be referred to a specialized center to\n      receive expert treatment. The use of ECMO might have a beneficial effect on overall patient\n      outcome, yet this has not been proven by clinical trials and to date ECMO is recommended as\n      measure of last resort in the current ARDS treatment guidelines. The timing of ECMO placement\n      to relieve hypoxia is an important question for the treating clinician but is not well\n      studied to date. This might also have impact on the long-term functional outcome of patients.\n      In addition, evidence about the role of ECMO in the outcome of COVID-19+ patients might have\n      significant impact on the referral of patients to a specialized center and is important for\n      the treating physician. Therefore, we want to pursue the questions whether early ECMO\n      placement is superior than the placement of ECMO as a rescue measure, and whether this could\n      result in improved overall outcome of patients with COVID-19+ ARDS."
