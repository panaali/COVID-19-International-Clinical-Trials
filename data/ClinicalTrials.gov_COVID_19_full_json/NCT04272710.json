            "textblock": "At present, the outbreak of the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection in Wuhan and Hubei\n      provinces has attracted great attention from the medical community across the country. Both\n      2019-nCoV and SARS viruses are coronaviruses, and they have a large homology.\n\n      Published laboratory studies have suggested that SARS virus infection and its lung injury are\n      related to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in lung tissue. And ACE and ACE2 in the\n      renin-angiotensin system (RAS) are vital central links to maintain hemodynamic stability and\n      normal heart and kidney function in vivo.\n\n      A large amount of evidence-based medical evidence shows that ACE inhibitors are the basic\n      therapeutic drugs for maintaining hypertension, reducing the risk of cardiovascular,\n      cerebrovascular, and renal adverse events, improving quality of life, and prolonging life in\n      patients with hypertension. Recent experimental studies suggest that treatment with ACE\n      inhibitors can significantly reduce pulmonary inflammation and cytokine release caused by\n      coronavirus infection."
