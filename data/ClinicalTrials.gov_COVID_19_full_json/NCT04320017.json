Furthermore, cases of\n      myocarditis have been reported with COVID-19.\n\n      Cardio-vascular events have possibly been highly underestimated. The study proposes to\n      systematically collect cardio-vascular data to study the incidence of myocarditis and\n      coronaropathy events during COVID-19 infection."
