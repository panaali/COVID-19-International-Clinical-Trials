Patients will be followed up to 12 months after\n      treatment.\n\n      State of the art:\n\n      Mesenchymal stem cells feature several attractive characteristics: ease of procurement, high\n      proliferation potential, capacity to home to inflammatory sites, anti-inflammatory,\n      anti-fibrotic and immunomodulatory properties. Their therapeutic benefits have been\n      demonstrated in > 100 animal models, including sheep. Specifically, the therapeutic effects\n      of MSC have been demonstrated in ARDS models induced by H1N1, H5N1, H9N2 influenza\n      virus-associated pneumoniae and were also shown to reduce bacterial-induced acute lung injury\n      in a human model of ex vivo perfused lung (Lee et al., 2013). In the clinics, MSC have\n      demonstrated an excellent tolerance in over 3,000 patients (Thompson et al., 2020),\n      regardless of the dosing and delivery route. Three phase I/II trials have included patients\n      with an ARDS and in one (START II), MSC significantly reduced pulmonary endothelial injury\n      (Matthay et al., 2019). If all MSC share several characteristics regardless of the tissue\n      source, the highest productions of bioactive molecules and the strongest immunomodulatory\n      properties are yielded by those from the Wharton's jelly of the umbilical cord (Romanov et\n      al., 2019) which can be scaled-up to generate banks of cryofrozen and thus readily available\n      products.\n\n      So far, UC-MSC have been used in a wide variety of diseases (reviewed in Scarfe et al., 2018)\n      and, in most cases, they have been delivered via the intravenous route which is clinically\n      attractive because of its non invasive nature and the subsequent possibility of repeated\n      administrations. Labeling techniques have shown that >80% of intravenously injected MSCs are\n      rapidly trapped in the lungs, followed by a rapid distribution of some of the injected MSCs\n      to other tissues including liver, spleen, and inflammatory or injured sites (Brooks et al.,\n      2018). Over all, these biodistribution patterns have been confirmed by human studies using\n      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) and/or single\u2010photon\n      emission computed tomography (SPECT).2 A four-parameter model (injection rate, clearance\n      rate, rate of extravasation and rate of intravasation) predicts that transplanted MSCs are\n      only therapeutically active for a short period of time (probably less than 24 h) (Parekkadan\n      and Milwid, 2010), a timescale consistent with that of the biological responses that they\n      trigger. These assumptions are an incentive to repeated MSC administrations within a short\n      period of time to induce a sustained therapeutic effect and has rationalized our protocol of\n      injecting MSC one every other day over a one week-period, a design consistent with the\n      earlier report of the benefits of delivering MSC at relatively small doses but in a repeated\n      fashion in patients with graft-versus-host disease (Zhou et al., 2010).\n\n      Once they have homed in the lungs, MSC have been reported to first induce an inflammatory\n      response which is detectable at the tissue level and systemically (Hoogduijn et al., 2013)\n      and is likely due to their interaction with resident lung cells once they have accumulated in\n      the microvasculature. This initial response is then followed by a downstream phase of reduced\n      immune reactivity (Hoogduijn et al., 2013), the mechanisms of which have been extensively\n      investigated. Thus, 24 hours after their intravenous infusion, most of the UC-MSC that have\n      accumulated in the lungs are dead after their phagocytosis by monocytes and neutrophils which\n      then migrate through the blood stream, particularly in the liver (Leibacher et al., 2017; de\n      Witte et al., 2018). Co-culture experiments have shown that the internalization of MSC\n      fragments by monocytes triggers a phenotypic shift which translates into the upregulation of\n      PD-L1 and CD90 along with an increased expression of mRNA levels for IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8 and\n      IL-10 and a decreased expression of TNF-\u03b1. Of note, monocytes polarized towards an\n      immune-regulatory phenotype increase the expression of Foxp3+ T regulatory lymphocytes while\n      decreasing that of activated CD4+ cells (de Witte et al., 2018). That apoptosis of\n      intravenously infused MSC is a requirement for their immunosuppressive function is further\n      supported by the observation that the cytotoxic activity against MSC is predictive of\n      clinical responses in patients treated by MSC for graft-versus-host disease, i.e., the best\n      responders are those with high cytotoxicity; in this study, the postulated mechanistic link\n      is that phagocytes that have engulfed apoptotic MSC then produce indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase\n      (IDO) and thus ultimately deliver MSC immunosuppressive activity (Galleu et al., 2017).\n\n      Given the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV2, it is thus sound to hypothesize that the intravenous\n      administration of UC-MSC during the initial phase of ARDS could control inflammation,\n      accelerate its recovery with improved oxygenation, reduced mechanical ventilation and\n      ventilation weaning time and therefore reduced length of stay in intensive care. This\n      assumption is indeed supported by the recent results of a preliminary Chinese trial in which\n      MSC (the source of which has not be specified) have been reported to improve pulmonary\n      function and symptoms in 7 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia along with a rapid clearance of\n      overactivated cytokine-secreting immune cells (CXCR3+CD4+ T cells, CXCR3+CD8+ T cells, and\n      CXCR3+ NK cells), a decrease in TNF-\u03b1 circulating levels and an increase in\n      CD14+CD11c+CD11bmid regulatory DC cells and IL-10 levels, compared with a placebo group (Leng\n      et al., 2020)."}, "overall_status": "Not yet recruiting", "start_date": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "April 1, 2020"}, "completion_date": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "May 31, 2021"}, "primary_completion_date": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "June 30, 2020"}, "phase": "Phase 1/Phase 2", "study_type": "Interventional", "has_expanded_access": "No", "study_design_info": {"allocation": "Randomized", "intervention_model": "Parallel Assignment", "primary_purpose": "Treatment", "masking": "Triple (Participant, Care Provider, Investigator)"}, "primary_outcome": {"measure": "Respiratory efficacy evaluated by the increase in PaO2/FiO2 ratio from baseline to day 7 in the experimental group compared with the placebo group", "time_frame": "From baseline to day 7"}, "secondary_outcome": [{"measure": "Lung injury score", "time_frame": "From baseline to day 28"}, {"measure": "Oxygenation index", "time_frame": "From baseline to day 28"}, {"measure": "In-hospital mortality", "time_frame": "From baseline to day 28"}, {"measure": "Mortality", "time_frame": "At day 28"}, {"measure": "Ventilator-free days", "time_frame": "From baseline to day 28"}, {"measure": "Number of days between randomization and the first day the patient meets weaning criteria o Number of days between randomization and the first day the patient meets PaO2/FiO2 > 200 (out of a prone positioning session)", "time_frame": "From baseline to day 28"}, {"measure": "Cumulative use of sedatives", "time_frame": "From baseline to day 28"}, {"measure": "Cumulative duration of use of sedatives", "time_frame": "From baseline to day 28"}, {"measure": "Cumulative duration of use of neuromuscular blocking agents (other than used for intubation)", "time_frame": "From baseline to day 28"}, {"measure": "Cumulative use of neuromuscular blocking agents (other than used for intubation)", "time_frame": "From baseline to day 28"}, {"measure": "ICU-acquired weakness and delirium", "time_frame": "From baseline to day 28"}, {"measure": "Treatment-induced toxicity rate and adverse events up to day 28", "time_frame": "From baseline to day 28"}, {"measure": "Quality of life at one year (EQ5D-3L quality of life questionnaire)", "time_frame": "At 6 months and 12 months"}, {"measure": "Measurements of plasmatic cytokines (IL1, IL6, IL8, TNF-alpha, IL10, TGF-beta, sRAGE, Ang2) level", "time_frame": "At day 1, 3, 5, 7 and 14"}, {"measure": "Anti-HLA antibodies plasmatic dosage", "time_frame": "From baseline to day 14, and at 6 months"}], "number_of_arms": "2", "enrollment": {"@type": "Anticipated", "#text": "60"}, "condition": ["Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2", "Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome"], "arm_group": [{"arm_group_label": "MSC", "arm_group_type": "Experimental"}, {"arm_group_label": "NaCl", "arm_group_type": "Placebo Comparator"}], "intervention": [{"intervention_type": "Biological", "intervention_name": "Umbilical cord Wharton's jelly-derived human", "description": "Umbilical cord Wharton's jelly-derived human MSC (at the dose of 1 Million / kg) will be administered via a peripheral or central venous line over 30-45 minutes, using tubing with a 200-\u03bcm filter.
