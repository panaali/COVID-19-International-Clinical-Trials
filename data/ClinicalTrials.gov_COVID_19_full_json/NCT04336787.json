As a\n      result, universities were closed during the spring semester and various institutions\n      interrupted their activities. In addition, the concept of voluntary quarantine was brought to\n      the agenda and people were asked to stay home as much as possible, staying away from social\n      contact. This period, which is not certain how to proceed and we are at the beginning, has\n      affected the daily life routines.\n\n      Our hypothesis are:\n\n        -  During the COVID-19 epidemic, the sleep quality of individuals of different age groups\n           who live their daily lives at home decreases.\n\n        -  During the COVID-19 epidemic, the stress level of individuals of different age groups\n           who live their daily lives at home increases.\n\n        -  During the COVID-19 epidemic, the level of physical activity of individuals of different\n           age groups who live their daily lives at home decreases.\n\n      The aim of the study is to determine the sleep quality, stress level and physical activity\n      level of people of different age groups who maintain the home quarantine after the COVID-19\n      epidemic"
