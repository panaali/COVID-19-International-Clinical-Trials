            "textblock": "Leukine\u00ae is a yeast-derived recombinant humanized granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating\n      factor (rhuGM-CSF, sargramostim) and the only FDA approved GM-CSF. GMCSF, a pleiotropic\n      cytokine, is an important leukocyte growth factor known to play a key role in hematopoiesis,\n      effecting the growth and maturation of multiple cell lineages as well as the functional\n      activities of these cells in antigen presentation and cell mediated immunity.\n\n      Leukine inhalation or intravenous administration, as an adjuvant therapy, may confer benefit\n      to patients with ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) due to COVID-19 exposure, who are\n      at significant risk of mortality. While there is no active IND (Investigational New Drug) for\n      Leukine in the proposed patient population, Leukine is being studied in Fase II as an\n      adjuvant therapy in the management of life-threatening infections to boost the hosts innate\n      immune response to fight infection, reduce the risk of secondary infection, and in varied\n      conditions as prevention of infection during critical illness. Inhaled Leukine has also been\n      successfully used as primary therapy to improve oxygenation in patients with disordered gas\n      exchange in the lungs. We propose that based on preclinical and clinical data, Leukine\n      inhalation, as an adjuvant therapy, has an acceptable benefit-risk for use in patients with\n      hypoxic respiratory failure and ARDS due to COVID-19 exposure, who are at significant risk of\n      mortality.\n\n      Confirmed COVID19 patients with hypoxic respiratory failure (saturation below 93% on minimal\n      2 l/min O2) will be randomized to receive sargramostim 125mcg twice daily for 5 days as a\n      nebulized inhalation on top of standard of care, or to receive standard of care treatment.\n      Upon progression to ARDS and initiation of invasive mechanical ventilator support within the\n      5 day period, in patients in the active group, inhaled sargramostim will be replaced by\n      intravenous sargramostim 125mcg/m2 body surface area until the 5 day period is reached. From\n      day 6 onwards, progressive patients in the active group will have the option to receive an\n      additional 5 days of IV sargramostim, based on the treating physician's assessment. In the\n      control group progressing to ARDS and requiring invasive mechanical ventilatory support, from\n      day 6 onwards, the treating physician will have the option to initiate IV sargramostim\n      125mcg/m2 body surface area for 5 days. Safety data, including blood leukocyte counts, will\n      be collected in all patients. Efficacy data will also be collected and will include arterial\n      blood gases, oxygenation parameters, need for ventilation, lung compliance, organ function,\n      radiographic changes, ferritin levels, etc. as well as occurrence of secondary bacterial\n      infections."
