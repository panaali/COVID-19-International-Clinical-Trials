The expert group discussed and made a\n      decision if the patient would be admission to isolation unit. Pharyngeal swabs of the\n      patients were obtained and sent to local Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for\n      detection the 2019 Novel Coronavirus after patients were admission to isolation unit.\n      Diagnosis of 2019 Novel Coronavirus infection was confirmed if the result was positive or\n      excluded if two consecutive results were negative. Patients' demographic data and clinical\n      characteristics were recorded. Clinical characteristics including epidemiological history,\n      past history, personal history, symptoms, signs, blood cells count, biochemical test results,\n      chest computed tomography (CT) images. 2019 Novel Coronavirus RNA was detected in pharyngeal\n      swab, anal swab, urine and blood samples by using quantitative real-time polymerase chain\n      reaction (qPCR). Comprehensive treatments were given to the patients."
