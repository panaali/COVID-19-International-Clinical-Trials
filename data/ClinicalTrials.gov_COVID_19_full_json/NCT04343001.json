Patients hospitalised without symptoms of acute COVID-19\n             infection should not be recruited even if they test positive for COVID-19.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Women known to be pregnant and patients already receiving or with a definite\n             indication or contraindication for any of the trial treatments are excluded.
