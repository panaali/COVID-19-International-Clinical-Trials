Non parametric and parametric\n      statistical analysis will be analysed in the efficacy of treatment. For the pair-wise\n      comparison, 2-sided p-value was used to ensure that the overall Type I error=0.05. Beta error\n      80%. Demographic and safety analyses were based on the summary of descriptive statistics.\n\n      Pre-randomization Phase The pre-randomization phase consisted of a screening period (0 to 1\n      day prior to randomization).\n\n      Screening Period (Day -1 to 0) At the screening visit and prior to performance of any study\n      procedures, the investigators would explain the details of the study and the subject would\n      have to sign on the written informed consent, exclusion criteria, and inclusion criteria Each\n      subject who was willing to enrol into the study was asked about their medical history as well\n      as their recent and current medications being taken. All enrolled subjects were asked to\n      undertake an initial physical examination and had to satisfy the criteria for the inclusion\n      /exclusion before being enrolled into the study.\n\n      All patients were asked to complete physical examination, CXR, CBC plt, proBNP, High\n      sensitive C reactive protein and Laboratory blood (livers tests, haematology,) examinations,\n      urine pregnancy test) were performed amount 5.5 mL for safety reasons. Nasopharyngeal swabs\n      were collected to detect the ORF 1ab and E genes (sensitivity: 1000 copies per milliliter) by\n      polymerase chain reactions. Will be performed The inclusion visit included the following\n      examination and tests: - physical examination,- vital signs,- weight,- CBC laboratory test\n      result,-Chest X ray or CT chest Blood for plasma cytokine assay -Pro BNP and High sensitive C\n      reactive protein, D dimer Treatment period All patient will be treated with specific arm for\n      10-14 days or until negative for Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected to detect the ORF 1ab\n      and E genes of SARS -CoV-2 for 3 consecutive tests every 24 -48 hours.
