In a short time, Chinese scientists had shared the genome\n      information of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from these pneumonia patients and developed a\n      real-time reverse transcription PCR (real time RT-PCR) diagnostic assay.\n\n      Whilst the outbreak is likely to have started from a zoonotic transmission event associated\n      with a large seafood market that also traded in live wild animals, it soon became clear that\n      person-to-person transmission was also occurring. The number of cases of infection with\n      2019-nCoV identified in Wuhan increased markedly over the later part of January 2020, with\n      cases identified in multiple other Provinces of China and internationally. Mathematical\n      models of the expansion phase of the epidemic suggested that sustained person-to-person\n      transmission is occurring, and the R-zero is substantially above 1, the level required for a\n      self-sustaining epidemic in human populations.\n\n      The clinical spectrum of 2019-nCoV illness appears to be wide, encompassing asymptomatic\n      infection, a mild upper respiratory tract infection, and severe viral pneumonia with\n      respiratory failure and even death. Although the per infection risk of severe disease remains\n      to be determined, case-fatality risk of 11-14% has been reported in several initial studies\n      of seriously ill patients and case-fatality has been estimated approximately at 2% overall.\n      Also the large number of cases in Wuhan has resulted in a large number of patients\n      hospitalised with pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen and sometimes more advance\n      ventilator support.\n\n      This new coronavirus, and previous experiences with SARS and MERS-CoV, highlight the need for\n      therapeutics for human coronavirus infections that can improve clinical outcomes, speed\n      recovery, and reduce the requirements for intensive supportive care and prolonged\n      hospitalisation.\n\n      Given no specific antiviral therapy for 2019-nCoV infection and the ready availability of\n      remdesvir as a potential antiviral agent, based on pre-clinical studies in SARS-CoV and\n      MERS-CoV infections, this randomized, controlled, double blind trial will evaluate the\n      efficacy and safety of remdesivir in patients hospitalized with severe 2019-nCoV respiratory\n      disease."
