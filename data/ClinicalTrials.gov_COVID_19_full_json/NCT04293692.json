It is mainly\n      characterized by fever, dry cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Some\n      patients may develop into rapid and deadly respiratory system injury with overwhelming\n      inflammation in the lung. Currently, there is no effective treatment in clinical practice.\n      The present clinical trial is to explore the safety and efficacy of Human Umbilical Cord\n      Mesenchymal Stem Cells (UC-MSCs) therapy for novel coronavirus pneumonia patients."}, "detailed_description": {"textblock": "Since late December 2019, human pneumonia cases infected by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)\n      were firstly identified in Wuhan, China. As the virus is contagious and of great epidemic,\n      more and more cases have found in other areas of China and abroad. Up to February 24, a total\n      of 77, 779 confirmed cases were reported in China. At present, there is no effective\n      treatment for patients identified with novel coronavirus pneumonia. Therefore, it's urgent to\n      explore more active therapeutic methods to cure the patients.\n\n      Recently, some clinical researches about the 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia published in\n      The Lancet and The New England Journal of Medicine suggested that massive inflammatory cell\n      infiltration and inflammatory cytokines secretion were found in patients' lungs, alveolar\n      epithelial cells and capillary endothelial cells were damaged, causing acute lung injury. It\n      seems that the key to cure the pneumonia is to inhibit the inflammatory response, resulting\n      to reduce the damage of alveolar epithelial cells and endothelial cells and repair the\n      function of the lung.\n\n      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are widely used in basic research and clinical application.\n      They are proved to migrate to damaged tissues, exert anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory\n      functions, promote the regeneration of damaged tissues and inhibit tissue fibrosis. Studies\n      have shown that MSCs can significantly reduce acute lung injury in mice caused by H9N2 and\n      H5N1 viruses by reducing the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and the recruitment of\n      inflammatory cells into the lungs. Compared with MSCs from other sources, human umbilical\n      cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) have been widely applied to various diseases due to their\n      convenient collection, no ethical controversy, low immunogenicity, and rapid proliferation\n      rate. In our recent research, we confirmed that UC-MSCs can significantly reduce inflammatory\n      cell infiltration and inflammatory factors expression in lung tissue, and significantly\n      protect lung tissue from endotoxin (LPS) -induced acute lung injury in mice.\n\n      The purpose of this clinical study is to investigate safety and efficiency of UC-MSCs in\n      treating pneumonia patients infected by 2019-nCoV. The investigators planned to recruit 48\n      patients aged from 18 to 75 years old and had no severe underlying diseases. In the cell\n      treatment group, 24 patients received 0.5*10E6 UC-MSCs /kg body weight intravenously\n      treatment 4 times every other day besides conventional treatment. In the control group, other\n      24 patients received conventional treatment plus 4 times of placebo intravenously. The lung\n      CT, blood biochemical examination, lymphocyte subsets, inflammatory factors, 28-days\n      mortality, etc will be evaluated within 24h and 1, 2, 4, 8 weeks after UC-MSCs treatment."}, "overall_status": "Withdrawn", "why_stopped": "Patients were transferred to designated hospitals for treatment as needed, the clinical trials\n    cannot be conducted.", "start_date": {"@type": "Actual", "#text": "February 24, 2020"}, "completion_date": {"@type": "Actual", "#text": "February 25, 2020"}, "primary_completion_date": {"@type": "Actual", "#text": "February 25, 2020"}, "phase": "N/A", "study_type": "Interventional", "has_expanded_access": "No", "study_design_info": {"allocation": "Randomized", "intervention_model": "Parallel Assignment", "primary_purpose": "Treatment", "masking": "Triple (Participant, Care Provider, Outcomes Assessor)"}, "primary_outcome": [{"measure": "Size of lesion area by chest imaging", "time_frame": "At baseline, Day 1, Week 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8", "description": "Evaluation of Pneumonia change"}, {"measure": "Blood oxygen saturation", "time_frame": "At baseline, Day 1, Week 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8", "description": "Evaluation of Pneumonia change"}], "secondary_outcome": [{"measure": "Rate of mortality within 28-days", "time_frame": "At baseline, Day 1, Week 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8", "description": "Marker for efficacy of treatment"}, {"measure": "Sequential organ failure assessment", "time_frame": "At baseline, Day 1, Week 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8", "description": "0-4 score, the higher the score is, the poor of the prognosis will be."}, {"measure": "Side effects in the UC-MSCs treatment group", "time_frame": "At baseline, Day 1, Week 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8", "description": "Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events"}, {"measure": "Electrocardiogram, the changes of ST-T interval mostly", "time_frame": "At baseline, Day 1, Week 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8", "description": "Markers of the heart function"}, {"measure": "Concentration of C-reactive protein C-reactive protein, immunoglobulin", "time_frame": "At baseline, Day 1, Week 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8", "description": "Markers of infection"}, {"measure": "CD4+ and CD8+ T cells count", "time_frame": "At baseline, Day 1, Week 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8", "description": "Marker of Immunology and inflammation"}, {"measure": "Concentration of the blood cytokine (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8,IL-10,TNF-\u03b1)", "time_frame": "At baseline, Day 1, Week 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8", "description": "Marker of Immunology and inflammation"}, {"measure": "Concentration of the myocardial enzymes", "time_frame": "At baseline, Day 1, Week 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8", "description": "Markers of the heart function"}], "number_of_arms": "2", "enrollment": {"@type": "Actual", "#text": "0"}, "condition": "COVID-19", "arm_group": [{"arm_group_label": "UC-MSCs treatment group", "arm_group_type": "Experimental", "description": "Participants will receive conventional treatment plus 4 times of 0.5*10E6 UC-MSCs /kg body weight intravenously at Day1, Day3, Day5, Day7)."}, {"arm_group_label": "Control group", "arm_group_type": "Placebo Comparator", "description": "Participants will receive conventional treatment plus 4 times of Placebo intravenously at Day1, Day3, Day5, Day7."}], "intervention": [{"intervention_type": "Biological", "intervention_name": "UC-MSCs", "description": "0.5*10E6 UC-MSCs /kg body weight suspended in 100mL saline containing 1% human albumin intravenously at Day1, Day3, Day5, Day7", "arm_group_label": "UC-MSCs treatment group"}, {"intervention_type": "Other", "intervention_name": "Placebo", "description": "100mL saline containing 1% human albumin intravenously at Day 1, Day 3, Day 5, Day 7", "arm_group_label": "Control group"}], "eligibility": {"criteria": {"textblock": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n          1.
