            "textblock": "Identification of a safe, effective treatment for individuals with mild or moderate COVID-19\n      that prevents disease progression and reduces hospitalization would reduce the burden on the\n      health system. High dose hydroxychloroquine is being evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 prevention and\n      COVID-19 disease treatment, but has a high risk of a number of potentially severe adverse\n      events. Recent evidence has indicated that the broad-spectrum macrolide azithromycin may have\n      some activity against coronaviruses. Here we propose an individually-randomized,\n      placebo-controlled trial to determine the efficacy of a single dose of azithromycin for\n      prevention of COVID-19 progression to hospitalization.\n\n      Participants will be invited to participate via clinical laboratories performing SARS-CoV-2\n      testing. With receipt of a positive test, patients will be sent an email or letter inviting\n      them to contact study staff for screening and enrollment if interested.\n\n      Potential participants will undergo remote eligibility screening with study staff prior to\n      enrollment. Upon determination of eligibility and signing electronic informed consent\n      documents, participants will be emailed baseline study forms and will be mailed their\n      randomized study treatment. At the end of the study (14 days), participants will be emailed a\n      final study questionnaire. Note that there will no contact between study staff and\n      participants in this trial, minimizing risk of infection spread."
