            "textblock": "The ongoing pandemic with the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) poses a massive threat to public\n      health. SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and may lead to severe acute respiratory distress\n      syndrome in affected individuals. No therapeutic intervention has yet been approved for\n      COVID-19, and initial interventional studies with single agents showed only minimal\n      improvement in outcome or were not convincing in design. Therefore, the CLOCC trial will\n      evaluate the efficacy and safety of a combination therapy consisting of hydroxychloroquine,\n      which was used already as single agent with some effect, together with camostat mesylate in\n      hospitalized patients with moderate COVID-19 infection. The rationale for this combination\n      therapy stems from the observation that hydroxychloroquine interferes with viral entry and\n      replication through several mechanisms including changes in endosomal pH and in glycosylation\n      of the ACE2 receptor, which serves as entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Camostat acts as\n      inhibitor of the host cell serine protease TMPRSS2, which is needed to prime the viral S\n      protein for cell entry. Participants will be recruited in a total of 6 German centers, and\n      the trial will be randomized (1:1) and enrolled in either the hydroxychloroquine + placebo or\n      the hydroxychloroquine + camostat arm (7-day treatment). The trial will be carried out in a\n      double-blinded fashion. The primary efficacy outcome is the number of patients discharged by\n      day 14 (status 1 and 2 of a 7-point ordinal clinical status scale). Several secondary\n      outcomes regarding efficacy but also safety will be evaluated. Exploratory endpoints include\n      analysis of viral titers and the emergence of viral resistance in response to therapy."
