            "textblock": "Telephone consultations as a method for telehealth do not provide visual cues and limit\n      interpretation of visual signs such as visualization of skin lesions. However, the need of\n      such feedback is almost non-existent for endoscopy-related consultations as their purpose is\n      focused. The main foci of endoscopy-related outpatient clinics are two: 1 - inform and\n      consent the patient for an endoscopic procedure that is to be done in the near future; 2 -\n      explain the results of a recent procedure already performed and which has a copy provided to\n      the patient. Therefore, phone consultations might be a good fit for endoscopy-related\n      outpatient clinics. The practicalities and indications for the use of phone consults has been\n      described by van Galen & Car (2018) and fit the above description.\n\n      Patients will be invited to participate only after the consultation have been finalised and\n      all questions regarding the endoscopic procedure to be done/that was done have been\n      clarified. Patients and consultants will fill questionnaires to evaluate the phone\n      consultation.\n\n      The primary outcome will the the comparison of \"failed to attend\" (FTA) occurrences compared\n      to a similar period of the past year. Secondary outcomes will be patients' and consultants'\n      satisfaction with the phone consultation."
