In the case of\n      SARS-CoV-2, the anticipated mechanism of action by which passive antibody therapy would\n      mediate protection is viral neutralization. The only antibody type that is currently\n      available for immediate use is that found in human convalescent plasma. As more individuals\n      contract COVID-19 and recover, the number of potential donors will continue to increase. The\n      investigators seek to treat participants who are sick enough to warrant hospitalization prior\n      to the onset of overwhelming disease."
