            "textblock": "Calpains are a class of non-lysosomal cysteine proteases involved in diverse cellular\n      processes. Several independent publications indicate that specific host cellular proteases\n      called dimeric calpains are essential for the replication of multiple RNA viruses including\n      Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-1. In 2004, Barnard and colleagues\n      described that the inhibition of calpains 1 and 2 by distinct calpain inhibitors, MDL 28170\n      and SJA 6017, resulted in anti-SARS-CoV activity by reducing infectious virus particle\n      replication and hence production (Barnard, 2004). This observation was reproduced with MDL\n      28170, which showed a >7-log reduction in SARS-CoV replication in cell culture systems\n      (Schneider, 2012). The anti-viral activity of the compound was confirmed to be due to\n      inhibition of m calpain by utilizing a small interfering RNA (siRNA) approach to selectively\n      silence expression of this dimeric calpain isoform. This confirmed the specific requirement\n      for dimeric m calpain activity during SARS-CoV replication in vitro (Schneider, 2012). MDL\n      28170 is a nonclinical tool calpain inhibitor compound with known off-target liabilities that\n      has not been evaluated in nonclinical or clinical safety studies.\n\n      It has been shown that the receptor for SARS-CoV-1 and -2 entry into the cell is\n      angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) (Kuba, 2010). ACE-2 and the dimeric calpains (data on\n      file) are co-expressed in respiratory epithelial cells, the site of both viral entry and\n      predominant early lung injury in COVID-19.\n\n      In addition to the potential for anti-viral activity by calpain inhibition, nonclinical\n      animal bleomycin lung injury models demonstrated that BLD-2660 normalized tissue IL-6 levels,\n      a proinflammatory cytokine demonstrated to be elevated in COVID-19 patients and is implicated\n      in disease pathogenesis. This pro-inflammatory cytokine has been shown to contribute to lung\n      damage during SARS-CoV infection and the virus itself is capable of directly inducing its\n      expression (Bozym, 2011; Yoon, 2008). Thus BLD-2660 could potentially reduce both viral\n      replication and the nonproductive host-response to infection, both contributors to morbidity\n      and mortality in COVID-19.\n\n      BLD2660, has shown greater selectivity for calpain inhibition than MDL 28170, the prototypic\n      calpain inhibitor utilized to effectively inhibit SARS-CoV replication. BLD-2660 lacks\n      cross-reactivity with other cysteine proteases such as cathepsins. The safety and\n      tolerability of BLD-2660 has been demonstrated in the recently completed Phase 1 single\n      ascending dose (SAD)/multiple ascending dose (MAD) B-2660-101 study.\n\n      This study will evaluate BLD-2660 as an add-on therapy to standard of care (SOC) in\n      hospitalized subjects with recent diagnosis of COVID-19."
