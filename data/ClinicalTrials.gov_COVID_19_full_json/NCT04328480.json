            "textblock": "Various anti-viral treatments are being tested in clinical trials worldwide. The World Health\n      Organization launched a simple,pragmatic worldwide open-label trial to test Remdesivir,\n      Lopinavir/Ritonavir, Interferon and Hydroxychloroquine or Chloroquine.The most important\n      complication of COVID-19 severe cases is respiratory failure from severe acute respiratory\n      syndrome (SARS), the leading cause of mortality. Accumulating evidence suggests that patients\n      with severe COVID-19 might have a cytokine storm syndrome, a hyperinflammatory syndrome\n      characterized by a fulminant and fatal hypercytokinemia and multiorgan failure.\n\n      The proposed pathophysiological mechanism of cytokine storm and inflammatory cascade\n      activation is based on evidence collected primarily during the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV\n      epidemics (with a significant increase in IL1B, IL6, IL12, IFN\u03b3, IP10, TNF\u03b1, IL15, and IL17\n      among others). The data collected during the pandemic with COVID-19 also shows a significant\n      increase in inflammatory cytokines (GCSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF\u03b1, among others) in\n      sicker patients admitted to intensive care. In the absence of effective treatments for the\n      management of patients with COVID-19 and respiratory failure, the immunomodulatory and\n      anti-inflammatory effect of colchicine on cytokines involved in the hyper-inflammatory state\n      is postulated. Several lines of research worldwide are testing powerful anti-inflammatory\n      drugs for the pandemic, with different options including steroids, cytokine blockers, and\n      other potent anti-inflammatory agents. Steroids are partially contraindicated in viral\n      infections.\n\n      Colchicine is a powerful anti-inflammatory drug approved for the treatment or prevention of\n      gout and Familial Mediterranean Fever at doses ranging between 0.3 mg and 2.4 mg/day. Its\n      mechanism of action is through the inhibition of tubulin polymerization, as well as through\n      potential effects on cellular adhesion molecules and inflammatory chemokines. It might also\n      have direct anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting key inflammatory signalling networks\n      known as inflammasome and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Additionally, evidence suggests that\n      colchicine exerts a direct anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting the synthesis of tumor\n      necrosis factor alpha and IL-6, monocyte migration, and the secretion of matrix\n      metalloproteinase-9. Through the disruption of the cytoskeleton, colchicine is believed to\n      suppress secretion of cytokines and chemokines as well as in vitro platelet aggregation. All\n      these are potentially beneficial effects that might diminish or ameliorate the COVID-19\n      inflammatory storm associated with severe forms of the disease. Importantly, in one\n      contemporary trial low-dose colchicine administered to patients who survived from acute\n      coronary syndrome shows a statistically significantly reduction of cardiovascular\n      complications.\n\n      We have therefore designed in a simple, pragmatic randomized controlled trial to test the\n      effects of colchicine on severe hospitalized COVID-19 cases with the aim of reducing\n      mortality."
