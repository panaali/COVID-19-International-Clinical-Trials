As of March 23, 2020, there have\n      been 382,341 documented episodes of infection worldwide, of which 16,567 have died. An\n      important limitation in the treatment of the disease is the absence of drugs with known\n      antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. Recent data suggest that chloroquine has sufficient in\n      vitro activity against the SARS-CoV-2 virus by inhibiting virus entry into cells. It has\n      recently been described that hydroxychloroquine significantly reduces the percentage of\n      patients who have positive sputum in the SARS-CoV-2 virus within 6 days. However, the\n      clinical efficacy of the drug has not been described and it has significant side effects,\n      including more than 10% anorexia, headache, blurred vision, diarrhea or vomiting, and\n      myocardiotoxicity. The frequency of adverse effects of chloroquine in combination with the\n      well-known in vitro activity of chloroquine have led to the design of clinical trials around\n      the world to document the benefits of its use. The present study will evaluate the activity\n      of chloroquine phosphate in patients with SARS-CoV-2 virus infection."
