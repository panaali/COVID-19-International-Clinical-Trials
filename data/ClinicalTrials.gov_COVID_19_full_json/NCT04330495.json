The strategy\n      will be carried out through a randomised double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial and\n      will assess comparative rates of infection (prevalence, incidence), severity including\n      mortality, impact on cl\u00ednical course of the primary diseases and toxicity. Such evaluation\n      will require prospective surveillance to assess the different end-points.\n\n      Drug interventions in this protocol will follow the Spanish law about off-label use of\n      medicines."
