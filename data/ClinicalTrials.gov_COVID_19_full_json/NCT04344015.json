Efforts\n      to initiate the collection and infusion of these products to high risk patients have been\n      initiated around the world and the FDA has recently provided information about how this could\n      be accomplished. As the Jefferson Blood Donor Center already has processes to collect, test\n      and process blood, we are planning to make efforts to collect plasma for this use should it\n      be necessary. The purpose of this study is to describe the process for identifying and\n      collecting convalescent plasma from donors previously infected with the virus. The research\n      portion on top of this standard blood product collection will the process of identification\n      of subjects and processes by which blood products are processed in this special population.\n      This protocol does not involve the administration of blood products to patients with COVID-19\n      infection."

Given that there is no current\n      medical treatment beyond supportive care for COVID-19, there is a great deal of interest in\n      using convalescent plasma for patients with COVID-19. As a first step in this process, we are\n      proposing to identify donors and collect plasma with antibodies against COVID-19. While the\n      intention is to use this for patients in the near future, the purpose of this study will be\n      to see if this is feasible and a separate application will be submitted related to the\n      treatment of patients with these products."
