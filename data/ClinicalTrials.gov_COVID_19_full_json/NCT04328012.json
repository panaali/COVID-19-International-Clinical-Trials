Lopinavir/ritonavir, an\n      antiretroviral medication, showed equivocal but possibly positive efficacy and safety in a\n      RCT conducted in China and published in NEJM in March of 2020. Hydroxychloroquine, an\n      antimalarial and anti-inflammatory medication, has shown potent antiviral activity in vitro\n      and elimination of viral shedding in a small pilot clinical trial. Losartan, an angiotensin\n      II receptor blocker (ARB), has theoretical benefit as SARSCoV-2 appears to bind to lung\n      tissue via Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors which might be inhibited by\n      ARBs. This pragmatic adaptive trial compares outcome in COVID-19 patients treated with\n      lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, losartan, and placebo."
