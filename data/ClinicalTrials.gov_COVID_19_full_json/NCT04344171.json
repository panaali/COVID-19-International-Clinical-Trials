            "textblock": "The exponentially increasing number of SARS-CoV-2 infected people, despite the influence of\n      the currently existing non-medical measures, is generating a rapidly increasing number of\n      inpatients, some of whom need artificial ventilation. The average focus is on the extent to\n      which the hospitals' capacities will be sufficient to adequately treat all patients.\n      Regardless of this, it can be expected that even if the non-medical measures are successful,\n      the number of inpatients treated will remain high in the course of the pandemic. With regard\n      to the distribution of infection, it can be expected that clinics with a wide range of\n      expertise will have to treat a large number of Covid-19 patients.\n\n      So far, however, there is little to no experience in treating patients. In addition to\n      epidemiological data, only case descriptions and some Chinese studies mostly from Wuhan based\n      on fewer patients are available. In view of the rapidly spreading pandemic, preprints are\n      increasingly being used. What has been missing so far is a uniform, structured recording of\n      the courses of Covid-19 inpatients handled by many clinics, which goes beyond the\n      epidemiological events in terms of depth of detail. With this documentation of real\n      processes, the basis for a large number of studies and the associated better understanding of\n      the disease process could be created.\n\n      The current dynamics make it imperative that the clinics, even those who have not received\n      the most up-to-date scientific knowledge, cannot wait for the results of studies, but rather\n      need concrete help in the treatment of patients. Efficient assistance within the framework of\n      a close exchange between the treatment units is only possible with a multicentre, uniform\n      documentation environment.\n\n      The aim of the project is to better understand the Covid-19 inpatient course of the disease\n      and to quickly identify the positive experiences in the treatment in order to update\n      guidelines for the treatment and use of medication."
