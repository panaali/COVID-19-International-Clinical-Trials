A different site (other than left arm) can be chosen if necessary\n\n          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding Although there is no evidence that BCG vaccination is\n             harmful during pregnancy or breastfeeding, it is a contra-indication to BCG\n             vaccination. Therefore, we will exclude women who think they could be pregnant.\n\n          -  Another live vaccine administered in the month prior to randomisation\n\n          -  Require another live vaccine to be administered within the month following BCG\n             randomisation If the other live vaccine can be given on the same day, this exclusion\n             criteria does not apply\n\n          -  Known anaphylactic reaction to any of the ingredient present in the BCG vaccine\n\n          -  BCG vaccine given within the last year\n\n          -  Has previously had a SARS-CoV-2 positive test result\n\n          -  Already part of this trial, recruited at a different hospital"
