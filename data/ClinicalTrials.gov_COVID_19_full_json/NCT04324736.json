            "textblock": "COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease-2019) is a life-threatening infectious disease caused by the\n      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that appeared in December 2019\n      in the Wuhan district. COVID-19 has since affected more than 150 countries across the world\n      and especially France. The first epidemiological data, mostly from Chinese studies, indicate\n      that diabetes is one of the most common comorbidities, with high blood pressure, in patients\n      with COVID-19. Moreover, the presence of diabetes at admission would be a risk factor for\n      both ICU hospitalization and death.\n\n      Nevertheless, specific data on people with diabetes and COVID-19 are fragmentary, justifying\n      the achievement of a dedicated prospective observational study.\n\n      The French nationwide CORONADO study aims to specifically describe the phenotypic\n      characteristics of patients with diabetes admitted to hospital with COVID-19 infection.\n      Particular attention will be devoted to glycemic control at admission (i.e. the level of\n      HbA1c), the diabetic complications, as well as anti-diabetic and antihypertensive therapies.\n\n      This study will provide answers to caregivers and patients with diabetes regarding the risk\n      factors related to diabetes for COVID-19 prognosis. This pilot study will be used for the\n      development of new studies and for the establishment of recommendations for the cost of care\n      in patients with diabetes and COVID-19."
