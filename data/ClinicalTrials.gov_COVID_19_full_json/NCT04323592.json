There is an urgent need for a solution\n      to the lack of ICU beds and increasing deaths day after day.\n\n      A recent retrospective Chinese paper (JAMA Intern Med, online March 13, 2020) showed\n      impressive positive effect of methylprednisolone (MP) on survival of SARS-CoV-2 critically\n      ill patients. We're routinely using MP for severe pneumonia-ARDS with acute respiratory\n      failure with very good results.\n\n      The main objective of this multi-centre observational trial is to evaluate the efficacy of\n      low dose prolonged infusion of methylprednisolone (MP) for patients with severe acute\n      respiratory syndrome."
