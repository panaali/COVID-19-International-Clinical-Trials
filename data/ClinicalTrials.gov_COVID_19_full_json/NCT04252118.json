There is no confirmed antivirus therapy for people infected\n      2019-nCoV, most of them should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. For severe\n      cases, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.

            "textblock": "2019-nCoV infection has become an urgent public health event in China. As of 24:00 on January\n      26, 2020, there are 2744 confirmed cases and 461 severe cases in China, the number is still\n      increasing. There is currently no vaccine and no specific antiviral treatment recommended for\n      2019-nCoV infection. About 20% of the patients were severe and some died of respiratory\n      failure or multiple organ failure. Therefore, it is urgent to find a safe and effective\n      therapeutic approach to pneumonia patients infected with 2019-nCoV.\n\n      In the last year, the promising features of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), including their\n      regenerative properties and ability to differentiate into diverse cell lineages, have\n      generated great interest among researchers whose work has offered intriguing perspectives on\n      cell-based therapies for various diseases. These findings seem to highlight that the\n      beneficial effect of MSC-based treatment could be principally due by the immunomodulation and\n      regenerative potential of these cells. The investigators found that infusions of UC-MSC\n      significantly improved liver function in decompensated liver cirrhosis and primary biliary\n      cirrhosis (PBC) patients, increased the survival rate in acute-on-chronic liver failure\n      (ACLF) patients . MSCs could significantly reduce the pathological changes of lung and\n      inhibit the cell-mediated immune inflammatory response induced by influenza virus in animal\n      model .\n\n      The purpose of this study is to investigate safety and efficiency of MSCs in treating\n      pneumonia patients infected with 2019-nCoV. This multi-center trial will recruit 20 patients.\n      10 patients received i.v. transfusion one round (3 times) of 3.0*10E7 cells of MSCs as the\n      treated group, all of them received the conventional treatment. In addition, the equal 10\n      patients received conventional treatment were used as control. The clinical symptoms,\n      pulmonary imaging, side effects, 28-days mortality, immunological characteristics (immune\n      cells, inflammatory factors, etc.) will be evaluated during the 180 days follow up."
