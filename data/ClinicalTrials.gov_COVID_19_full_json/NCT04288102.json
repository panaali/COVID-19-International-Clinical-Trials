            "textblock": "The epidemic of 2019 novel coronavirus (causing the disease Covid-19) has expanded from Wuhan\n      throughout China and is being exported to a growing number of countries, some of which have\n      seen onward transmission. COVID-19 caused clusters of severe respiratory illness and was\n      associated with 2% mortality. There is currently no vaccine and no specific antiviral\n      treatment recommended for COVID-19. About 20% of the patients were severe and the mainstay of\n      clinical management is largely symptomatic treatment, with organ support in intensive care\n      for seriously ill patients. Therefore, it is urgent to find a safe and effective therapeutic\n      approach to COVID-19.\n\n      In the last years, the promising features of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), including their\n      regenerative properties and ability to differentiate into diverse cell lineages, have\n      generated great interest among researchers whose work has offered intriguing perspectives on\n      cell-based therapies for various diseases. These findings seem to highlight that the\n      beneficial effect of MSC-based treatment could be principally due by the immunomodulation and\n      regenerative potential of these cells. MSCs could significantly reduce the pathological\n      changes of lung and inhibit the cell-mediated immune inflammatory response induced by\n      influenza virus in animal model . MSCs has been shown to reduce nonproductive inflammation\n      and affect tissue regeneration and is being evaluated in patients with ARDS. Our phase I\n      preliminary data of parallel assignment study(NCT04252118) showed that three doses of MSCs\n      was safe in patients with COVID-19. Randomized control trial is needed to assess efficacy and\n      safety.\n\n      The investigators will do a prospective, double-blind, multicentre, randomised trial to\n      assess treatment with three intravenous doses of MSCs compared with placebo. 90 severe\n      COVID-19 patients will be recruited in China. 60 patients will receive i.v. transfusion 3\n      times of MSCs\uff08 4.0*10E7 cells per time) and the conventional treatment as the treated group.\n      In addition, the 30 patients will receive placebo and conventional treatment as control\n      group.\n\n      Size of lesion area and severity of pulmonary fibrosis by chest CT,mMRC (Modified Medical\n      Research Council) dyspnea scale, 6-minute walk test, maximum vital capacity (VCmax),\n      Diffusing Capacity (DLCO), oxygen saturation, oxygenation index, duration of oxygen therapy,\n      side effects, immunological characteristics (immune cells, inflammatory factors, etc.) will\n      be evaluated during the 90 days follow up."
