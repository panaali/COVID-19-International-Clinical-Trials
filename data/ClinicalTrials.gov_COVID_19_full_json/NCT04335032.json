Potential subjects will have the opportunity to ask any questions to the\n      researchers.\n\n      A member of the research team will provide a copy of the information sheet to the subject,\n      who will have the opportunity to ask any questions to the researchers.\n\n      Subjects expressing an interest in participating will be interviewed to explain the study in\n      detail, and discuss the risks, benefits, goals and limitations of the study.\n\n      Screening Procedures. Potentially eligible subjects will provide informed consent prior to\n      any study specific procedures being conducted.\n\n      Following the provision of informed consent, the subject's demographics and medical history\n      especially that relating to SARS-CoV-2 will be documented.\n\n      A physical examination and checks on vital signs (BP, pulse, temperature, respiration) will\n      be conducted.

Subjects will undergo\n      tests for oxygen saturation, PaO2/FiO2 and interleukin-6 (IL-6).\n\n      Subjects will be asked to provide details of any concomitant medications. Subjects with\n      confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, compliance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria and\n      providing informed consent will be registered on the e-CRF to obtain a randomisation number.\n      Subjects will be stratified by 1) whether subjects age is \u2265 65 years and 2) whether subjects\n      PaO2/FiO2 <200mmHg. Stratification will be performed at the country level to ensure balanced\n      treatment groups within each country.\n\n      Baseline/Randomisation A physical examination and checks on vital signs (BP, pulse,\n      temperature, respiration) will be conducted. Subjects will undergo tests for oxygen\n      saturation, PaO2/FiO2 and interleukin-6. Haematology and biochemistry test (from screening)\n      results will be confirmed as being acceptable.\n\n      Subjects will be randomised (1:1) to one of the two study arms: EPA-FFA gastro-resistant\n      capsules or standard of care treatment.\n\n      The subjects, in the investigational medicinal product (IMP) group, will be trained on the\n      dosing and asked to administer two capsules twice daily for 4 weeks. Subjects will then be\n      provided with IMP on a daily basis by a suitably qualified and delegated member of the\n      Investigator's team, for the duration of the treatment phase.\n\n      Treatment Phase (Week 1-3) All subjects will receive standard of care treatment throughout\n      the treatment phase on a day to day basis. This will include assessment of additional or\n      alternative medication required for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2, requirement for intubation\n      and invasive ventilation, requirement to transfer to intensive care unit or death.\n\n      On a weekly basis, a physical examination and checks on vital signs (BP, pulse, temperature,\n      respiration) will be conducted. Subjects will undergo tests for oxygen saturation, PaO2/FiO2\n      and IL-6.\n\n      Subjects will be asked to provide details of any concomitant medications and changes in\n      condition via adverse event (AE) query.\n\n      Week 4 A physical examination and checks on vital signs (BP, pulse, temperature, respiration)\n      will be conducted. Subjects will undergo tests for oxygen saturation, PaO2/FiO2 and IL-6.\n      Female subjects of child-bearing potential will undergo a urine pregnancy test. A blood\n      sample will be drawn for routine haematology and biochemistry. Subjects will be asked to\n      provide details of any concomitant medications and changes in condition via AE query.\n\n      Week 6 (Follow -up) 6 weeks after randomisation (or two weeks after early withdrawal), the\n      subject will be contacted to check the occurrence of any other adverse events and review of\n      medications.
