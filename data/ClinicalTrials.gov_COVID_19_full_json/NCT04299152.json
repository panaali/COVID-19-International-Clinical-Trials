            "textblock": "Currently, the growing epidemic of a new coronavirus infectious disease (Covid-19) is\n      wreaking havoc worldwide, which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome\n      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 is a RNA virus that display high similarity in both\n      genomic and proteomic profiling with SARS-CoV that first emerged in humans in 2003 in China.\n      Therefore, preventing and controlling the pandemic occurrences are extremely urgent as a\n      global top priority. Due to the lack of effective antiviral drugs, patients may be treated by\n      only addressing their symptoms such as reducing fever. Clinical autopsies from\n      SARS-CoV-infected patients demonstrated that there were major pathological changes in the\n      lungs, immune organs, and small systemic blood vessels with vasculitis. However, the\n      detection of SARS-CoV were primarily found in the lung and trachea/bronchus, but was\n      undetectable in spleen, lymph nodes, bone marrow, heart and aorta, highlighting the\n      overreaction of immune responses induced by viral infection were really harmful, resulting in\n      the pathogenesis of lungs, immune organs, and small systemic blood vessels. To this respect,\n      immune modulation strategy may be potentially beneficial to enhance anti-viral immunity and\n      efficiently reduce the viral load, improve clinical outcomes, expedite the patient recovery,\n      and decline the rate of mortality in patients after being infected with SARS-CoV-2. Tianhe\n      Stem Cell Biotechnologies Inc. has developed a novel globally-patented Stem Cell Educator\n      (SCE) technology designed to reverse the autoimmune response in Type 1 diabetes (T1D),\n      Alopecia Areata (AA) and other autoimmune diseases. SCE therapy uses human multipotent cord\n      blood stem cells (CB-SC) from human cord blood. Their properties distinguish CB-SC from other\n      known stem cell types, including mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and hematopoietic stem cells\n      (HSC). Several clinical studies show that SCE therapy functions via CB-SC induction of immune\n      tolerance in autoimmune T cells and restore immune balance and homeostasis in patients with\n      T1D, AA and other inflammation-associated diseases. To correct the overreaction of\n      overreaction of immune responses, the investigators plan to treat SARS-CoV-2 patients with\n      Stem Cell Educator therapy."

Subjects\n      who meet all criteria will be scheduled for treatment. All enrolled subjects will receive one\n      treatment with the SCE therapy consisting of a single session of mononuclear cells (MNC)\n      collection by apheresis of blood. The MNC product will be treated with the SCE, and followed\n      by an infusion intravenously back to the patient.
