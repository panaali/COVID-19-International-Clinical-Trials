In addition to its somatic and economic consequences, the psychological\n      dimension of SARS-CoV-2 is discussed increasingly and is visible in public life - e.g. in the\n      \"pandemic-caused experience of threat\", \"loss of control\" and \"panic\" of multiple people. The\n      study examines the phenomenon of this \"corona-related anxiety\" in terms of epidemiological,\n      clinical and psychosocial characteristics. It is investigated how \"corona anxiety\" affects\n      people who already have an anxiety disorder or other mental illnesses as well as formerly\n      mentally healthy people. It is also examined how media reporting and personal consequences of\n      SARS-CoV-2 are related to corona-related anxiety and if there is a need for therapeutic\n      support regarding corona-related anxiety.\n\n      To answer these questions a longitudinal online survey targeting the general population in\n      Germany is carried out. The survey takes place all three weeks as long as the pandemic lasts\n      and ends with one follow-up one year later."
