If we can\n      identify sick participants early, participants are more likely to have better outcomes; we\n      believe that the sensor can help us do this. The sensor measures heart rate, respiratory rate\n      and temperature every 2 minutes and this can be reviewed by the clinical team looking after\n      the participants."
