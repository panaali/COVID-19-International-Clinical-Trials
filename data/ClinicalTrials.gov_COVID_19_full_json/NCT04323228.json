            "textblock": "COVID-19 pandemic threatens patients, societies and healthcare systems around the world. The\n      host immunity determines the progress of the disease and its lethality. The associated\n      cytokine storm mainly affects the lungs; leading to acute lung injury with variable degrees.\n      Modulation of cytokine production using Immunonutrition is a novel concept that has been\n      applied to other diseases. Using specific nutrients such as n3- fatty acids and antioxidant\n      vitamins in extraordinary doses modulate the host immune response and ameliorate the cytokine\n      storm associated with viral diseases such as COVID-19. In this proposal, we will conduct a\n      prospective double-blinded controlled trial for 14 days on 30 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases. The\n      participant will be randomly assigned to two groups (n=15/each); intervention (IG) and\n      placebo (PG) groups. The IG group will be provided with an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant\n      oral nutrition supplement (ONS) on a daily basis, while the PG will be given an isocaloric\n      placebo. Basal and weekly nutritional screening, as well as recording of anthropometric,\n      clinical and biochemical parameters, will be done. The main biochemical parameters include\n      serum ferritin level, cytokine storm parameters (interleukin-6, Tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, and\n      monocyte chemoattractant protein 1), C-reactive protein, total leukocyte count, differential\n      lymphocytic count and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio. It is expected that the\n      anti-inflammatory-antioxidant ONS might help in the reduction of the COVID-19 severity with\n      more preservation of the nutritional status of infected cases."

All participants will sign a written consent after details of\n      the study have been fully explained to them. Later on, they will be randomly allocated into\n      two study groups; intervention group (IG, n=15) and placebo group (PG, n=15).\n      Computer-generated random numbers will be used to randomize the participants into one of two\n      intervention groups. The study protocol will be approved by the IRB committee in King Khalid\n      University Hospital, King Saud University Medical city. This clinical trial will be\n      registered in the clinicaltrials.gov registry.\n\n      Settings: All participants will be SARS-CoV-2 positive cases admitted to King Khalid\n      University Hospital.\n\n      Study protocol: All study participants will be instructed to either consume 8 fl oz oral\n      nutrition supplement (ONS) enriched in eicosapentaenoic acid, gamma-linolenic acid and\n      antioxidants (Oxepa, Abbott Nutrition, Abbott Laboratories) or iso-caloric -isonitrogenous\n      product (by the same manufacture). The ONS will be served in opaque glasses of the same shape\n      and color and should be ingested in the morning under the supervision of a nurse. The ONS\n      should not be consumed at the time of a meal. The composition of one can of the\n      intervention-ONS includes: 14.8 g protein, 22.2 g fat, 25 g carbohydrate, 355 kcal, 1.1 g\n      EPA, 450 mg DHA, 950 mg GLA, 2840 IU vitamin A as 1.2 mg \u03b2-carotene, 205 mg Vitamin C, 75 IU\n      vitamin E, 18 ug Selenium, and 5.7 mg Zinc. The composition of the control-ONS will have the\n      same macronutrient composition, calorie density, and normal concentrations of vitamin A, C,\n      E, Selenium and zinc.\n\n      All participants will be assessed at the start and reassessed again after 1 week and after\n      14-days period. The assessment will include nutritional screening by Nutritional risk\n      screening 2002 (NRS-2002), anthropometric measurements, clinical assessment, and biochemical\n      data.\n\n      Statistical analysis: The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25 will\n      be used for analysis. The descriptive statistics for continuous variables will be presented\n      as mean \u00b1 standard deviation, while other categorical variables as percentages. The\n      independent sample t-test will be used for comparison between the IG and PG groups. For\n      repeated measures at multiple points of time will be tested by Friedman's two-way ANOVA. The\n      Pearson correlation coefficient will be applied to correlate some relevant variables. All\n      these tests were performed with 80% power and a 5% level of significance."
