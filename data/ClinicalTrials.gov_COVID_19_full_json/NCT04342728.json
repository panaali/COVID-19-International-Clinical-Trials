A secondary purpose is to see whether Zinc and/or\n      Ascorbic acid supplementation can prevent progression of the severe manifestations of the\n      disease including development of dyspnea and acute respiratory distress syndrome which may\n      require hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, and or lead to death.\n\n      This is a single-center, prospective, randomized study which plans to enroll 520 patients\n      with a principal diagnosis of COVID-2019, managed in an outpatient setting, who presented\n      after being sent by a healthcare provider to get tested and receive a PCR (Polymerase Chain\n      Reaction) -assay based confirmed diagnosis of the disease. All patients who agree to\n      participate in the study will answer a baseline questionnaire about their symptoms at the\n      time of inclusion. Patients will then be randomized to one of 4 study arms. Patients in Arm A\n      (n=130) will receive vitamin C (to be taken divided over 2-3 times a day with meals),\n      patients in Arm B (n=130) will receive zinc gluconate to be taken at bedtime, patients in Arm\n      C (n=130) will receive both vitamin C (to be taken divided over 2-3 times a day with meals)\n      and zinc gluconate (taken at bedtime). Patients in arms A, B and C will take study\n      supplements daily for 10 days. Patients in Arm D (n=130) will not receive any of the study\n      medications and continue on standard of care. Patients will then track their symptoms daily\n      from day 0 to day 28 answering 4 basic questions on illness severity.They will stop filling\n      out their daily questions once they reach 0 for all categories or they reach the end of the\n      28 day study period. Study team members will call patients at days 7, 14, 21, and 28 of the\n      study period to assess need for hospitalization, ER visit, or additional medications\n      prescribed by a healthcare provider, and any side effects from the supplements that the\n      patient could have experienced."
