Patients\n      will be randomized to intravenous Aviptadil will receive escalating doses from 50 -150\n      pmol/kg/hr over 12 hours."

            "textblock": "Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome is a known lethal complication of Corona Virus (COVID-19)\n      infection. Conventional medical therapy, including intensive care and respiratory support is\n      associated with a 50% mortality. Aviptadil, a synthetic form of Vasoactive Intestinal\n      Polypeptide (VIP) has been awarded FDA Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of ARDS.\n\n      Nonclinical studies demonstrate that VIP is highly concentrated in the lung, where it\n      prevents NMDA-induced caspase-3 activation in the lung, inhibits IL6 and TNFa production,\n      protects against HCl-induced pulmonary edema, These and other effects have been observed in\n      numerous animal model systems of lung injury in mice, rats, guinea pigs, sheep, swine, and\n      dogs. In these models, Aviptadil restores barrier function at the endothelial/alveolar\n      interface and thereby protects the lung and other organs from failure.\n\n      Aviptadil is approved for human use in Europe and has a demonstrated 20 year history of\n      safety in numerous trials for Sarcoid, Pulmonary Fibrosis, Bronchospasm, Erectile\n      Dysfunction, and a phase I trial in ARDS. In that phase I trial, 8 patients with severe ARDS\n      on mechanical ventilation were treated with ascending doses of VIP. Seven of the 8 patients\n      were successfully extubated and were alive at the five day timepoint. Six left the hospital\n      and one died of an unrelated cardiac event.\n\n      Five phase 2 trials of aviptadil have been conducted under European regulatory authority.\n      Numerous healthy volunteer studies have shown that i.v. infusion of Aviptadil is well\n      tolerated with few adverse effects including alterations in blood pressure, heart rate, or\n      ECG. In addition to published studies of human use, Aviptadil has been used on a compounded\n      basis in certain ICUs for many years in the belief that it preserves life and restores\n      function in pulmonary hypertension, ARDS, and Acute Lung Injury (ALI).\n\n      In this study, patients who are hospitalized and intubated for ARDS secondary to COVID-19\n      infection will be randomly allocated to Aviptadil administered by intravenous infusion in\n      addition to maximal intensive care vs. maximal intensive care alone. Primary endpoints will\n      be improvement in blood oxygenation and mortality."
