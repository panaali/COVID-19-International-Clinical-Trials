Clinical improvement: normalization of the body temperature (=37.2 ° C), respiratory rate (=24 breaths per minute), oxygen saturation (> 94% at room temperature) and cough (zero or mild) that persist for at least 24 hours. Cough will measure on a qualitative scale based on the patient's report . Other outcome variables will measure during clinical examination.;Complications of the treatment.

In view of the need for rapid and ongoing data analysis and production of guidance, we will use a specific web-based rapid reporting and data collection system for this study to enable UKOSS nominated clinicians to report cases as they occur.
